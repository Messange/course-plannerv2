Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2410 Science & Religion in Dialogue  (4 Credits),"This course examines the relationship between science and religion.  Our key question is “What is the best way to understand or construe this relationship?”  We begin by attempting to identify and, then, dispel certain popular “myths” about science and religion.  Then we turn our attention to the life, the scientific discoveries, the religious commitments and struggles of Charles Darwin.  Darwin’s career is the perfect entry point for considering much broader issues in the relationship between science and religion.  Darwin’s evolutionary theory fundamentally shaped modern science.  But in so doing it also raised significant challenges to traditional religious belief, particularly in Christian communities of faith.  For that reason, Darwin is as controversial today as he was 150 years ago, especially in (tho’ not limited to) America.  With that foundation, we shall be in a position to wrestle with a quite recent, thorough-going reassessment of the science/religion debate, one that is both critical and constructive.

Michelle Alexander's book, The New Jim Crow, argues “we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it."" The course investigates her argument: what would it mean for mass incarceration to be the New Jim Crow? What does that framing reveal, and what does it conceal?

Specific examples raise broader questions about racism in American political history, political power, and political change.",4,Unknown

Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2414 Wealth, Power & Justice in the European Union  (4 Credits)","This course explores the regional integration of Europe in the postwar era.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2416 France and Germany: From Carnage to Community  (4 Credits),"Today, much to the United Kingdom's chagrin, the European Union is dominated by a closely cooperating ""dyarchy"" of the French Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Go back a century, however, or two or three, and you find France--whether republic (1909), empire (1809), or kingdom (1709)--preparing for war with Germany (1909) or catching her breath between campaigns against various German states (1809, 1709). Hundreds of years of European history are marked and marred by increasingly devastating collisions between these two proud nations. When we review and appreciate that bloody ""back-story,"" their present harmony, indeed on many important matters their unison, is an astonishing outcome, which this course attempts to explain, examining implications for the future of Europe, of the Western alliance, and of the world.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2417 Cultural Dynamics-African American Music  (4 Credits),"This course examines the cultural and psychological functions of various genres of African American music both historically and in contemporary society.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2423 The American Road Trip  (4 Credits),"As Frederick Jackson Turner told us back in the 19th Century, American cultural identity has hinged on the idea of an ever-receding frontier and the possibility of reaching it. We will chart how the road figures as both a promise and a burden, and how it reflects changing social and cultural issues in American life.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2436 Life and Death  (4 Credits),"In this course, students examine several of the moral issues concerning the circumstances under which it is appropriate for humans to bring about life or death. For example, is it morally permissible to bring about, and subsequently destroy, human life in a petri dish? Is it permissible to bring about the death of people who have killed others? We examine and evaluate others' responses to such issues. En route to answering these questions, we pay significant attention to the scientific and empirical factors relevant to which moral responses we should have and to the legal factors determining the actual policies we do have.",4,Unknown

Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2439 Music, Politics, and Policy  (4 Credits)","Music is often considered a positive, peace-building force in the world. Like all other forms of human expression (e.g., speech, prose), however, music engages with diverse political agendas and ideals, from peaceful humanist ones to violent nationalist ones. This course examines the ways in which politics and policies engage with popular, jazz, folk, and classical musics around the world. Students will explore contemporary and historical cases in which governments and NGOs foster, transform, reject, and otherwise use musics to promote their own ideas about local economies, national cultures, diplomacy, democracy, innovation, cultural diversity, and even criminal law. The course asks how might music and the arts more broadly have a unique role in these contexts? How is artistic expression different from other forms of human expression here? Can music promote peace? Democracy? How? How do governments create local and national music scenes? Which local and national cultures do they promote and protect? To what end? It looks at how the Cuban government has embraced rap music as emblematic of the nation’s revolutionary ethos; how the United States government used jazz as a diplomatic tool during the Cold War; how NGOs in Israel and Palestine used popular and classical musics to promote peace and understanding; how American courts have used rap music as evidence in criminal cases; and how funding and intellectual property laws impact musical ownership, tradition, innovation, and creativity.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2440 Traumatic Encounters through the Lenses of Philosophy and Literature  (4 Credits),"The course explores the intersection of philosophy and literature in relationship to trauma, art, politics and the modern ecological crisis. The course is divided into three parts, each exploring a way that philosophy and literature address the challenges and dilemmas of our contemporary situation, from questions about human sovereignty, freedom and dignity to questions concerning technology, the natural world and global economic justice. In part one, “Sovereignty and Bare Life,” questions related to state power, love, intergenerational conflict and displacement are explored through consideringShakespeare’s King Lear and Giorgio Agamben’s Homo Sacer. Part two, “Remembering the Future: Trauma and Time’s Remainders,” considers how F. W. J. Schelling’s Ages of the World and Toni Morrison’s Beloved respond to personal and historical traumas, and how these works redefine time, memory and belonging. Part three, “The Ends of the World: Poetry and Philosophy in a Time of Crisis,” confronts the unfolding ecological crisis through an exploration of W. S. Merwin’s poetry and the late, poetically inspired philosophy of Martin Heidegger. The course is multiperspectival in terms of disciplinary and thematic content an in terms of methodology. Readings highlight how concepts, methods and interpretive strategies of philosophy, can augment analysis of literary works, while literature can not only enliven philosophical argument but approach the limits of what can be communicated philosophically.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2441 Changing Meaning of Adulthood  (4 Credits),"When does a person reach adulthood? Age 18? Age 40? Never? What is adulthood, and how do we measure it?

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2450 Settler Colonialism: Pasts/Presents/Futures  (4 Credits),"Informed by work in critical indigenous studies, this course examines settler colonialism as a particular form of colonialism which is not a phenomena of the past but one that is central to the organization of contemporary society. Starting with the theft of indigenous lands, settlers unleashed processes that have had far-reaching impact across several domains. These range from altering the sexual organization of the family and the economic organization of society to the use of technologies and processes developed against indigenous people to oppress non-indigenous racial and other minorities. This class explores all these phenomena starting with the profound life-altering impact that settler-colonialism has for indigenous people and then branches out to explore the place of settlers, non-indigenous people of color, and other minorities in the settler-colonial matrix. Furthermore, the class explores settler colonialism as a transnational phenomenon by looking at other settler-colonial sites such as Palestine/Israel, Australia, and New Zealand, among others.

The media play a role in that disconnect. We live in a world where no single entity can exercise a monopoly over communication channels. Hence, partisan media, ideologically-driven news outlets, social networking sites, and encrypted messaging apps serve as venues harboring polarizing, contested rhetoric that catalyzes fear.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2466 When Love Becomes Weapon: Charm in International Relations  (4 Credits),"Scholars of international relations have long believed that it is better to be feared than to be loved. However, as America prevailed over the Soviet Union in the Cold War, a new theory emerged: America won simply because it was perceived to be more attractive than the Soviet Union. America won because of its values, not its guns.  How might we assess this argument? What goes into the making of American power: missiles or Rock’n’Roll? To what extent has China, among other competitors, challenged American soft power? Where should one draw the line between soft power and propaganda? What is the future of soft power, as countries' pursuits of their national interest often collide with transnational common issues like protecting the environment?

Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2499 Mountains: Ecology, Imagination, Aesthetics, and Challenges  (4 Credits)","Why are people drawn to mountains? What geological and biological features account for our interest, and how might the psychology and philosophy of aesthetics explain why mountains have multiple uses and effects, recreational to religious? How have writers, artists, filmmakers, climbers, skiers, and hikers historically represented mountain experiences? And what are the economic and ecological consequences of all this attention?

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2504 Land and Law in Africa: The Politics of Land Acquisition and Distribution  (4 Credits),"In settler colonies in Southern and East Africa, millions of African people were displaced from the land on which they had lived for centuries to make way for European settlement and agriculture. In the postcolonial era, these countries have attempted to redress these legacies by legally redistributing land from the descendants of white farmers to Black farmers and shareholders, with controversial results.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2509 Communication and Production of Cultures  (4 Credits),"Profound changes in the last two decades on the global, national and local scales have brought about a collapse in people’s traditional sources of self-definition, notably those ethnic, racial, geographic, sexual and national bases of group belonging and identity. Given such undermining of the old certainties, answers to the question ""Who am I?"" have become more tenuous, if not totally ""up for grabs."" Fragmentation of identities, ethnic conflict, social alienation and a loss of a sense of grounding are only some of the noted hallmarks of the present time. This course is designed to address the implications of this shift in signification--from identity to difference--for the dynamics of identity formation and the search for alternative bases for consensus-formation in the new millennium.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2510 India: Caste/race/religion  (4 Credits),"India: Caste/race/religion explores the idea that caste is the foundational structure of Indian society and that all the modern problems that plague India—casteism and untouchability, the genocidal treatment of Dalits and Muslims, the degradation of women and queer people, communalism, and the systematic disenfranchisement of a majority of Indian society, to name a few—have their foundations in caste.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2513 Constructing Freedom and Bondage  (4 Credits),"Historically, claims about what it means to be free -- or even human -- have been made through  discourses about enslavement and imprisonment; some have used bondage as a trope to explore  philosophical or artistic projects, while others have used it to interrogate the assumptions of various political and economic paradigms. Others, still, have used these tropes as a means of advocating for social change, notably through slavery and prison abolition movements. This course examines how writers such as Hegel, Frederick Douglass, Angela Davis, and Dylan Rodríguez define the relationship between freedom and bondage, and it examines the stakes of those definitions for an American ethos deeply invested in the concept of freedom.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2517 Prostitutes of the Pen and Novel: 18th Century Women Novelists  (4 Credits),"In Seductive Forms (1986), leading feminist scholar Ros Ballaster famously coined the phrase “prostitutes of the pen” to describe the common perception regarding the first English professional female authors of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. It encapsulates the cultural conditions with which women had to contend and their ex-tremely limited options for earning a living. We will trace the social, economic, and histor-ical issues with which English society, particularly the women of the eighteenth century, faced. The eighteenth century witnessed the rise of capitalism, trade, the merchant class, and with these various developments also saw “the separation of spheres”—the domestic from the public. This separation of the domestic from the public constructed a division between men and women, whereby men ruled the public world: economy, politics, and education, and women were relegated to the home and excluded from the public sphere. One of the major effects of this division was the lack of professional opportunities for women. Other than acting as domestic servants, there was little chance for financial inde-pendence. Therefore, these “prostitutes of the pen” were true pioneers, women who creat-ed a profession for themselves and a way to survive. Beginning with these early British novelists, this course intends to investigate the history and work of English women writ-ers in the eighteenth century, extending to the end of the century.  Additionally, this course seeks to explore women’s history in the eighteenth century—their educational and professional opportunities and the ways in which patriarchy, property, and English law affected women and informed their fictional works. Moreover, this course will assess how novels afforded these women authors a voice of protest as well as at times becoming a voice of consent within popular culture.",4,Unknown

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2529 Analyzing the American Dream - Expressionist Film in 1950's Hollywood  (4 Credits),"This course focuses on the output of a few Hollywood directors (primarily Ida Lupino, Nicholas Ray and Douglas Sirk) who seem to reflect the dominant ideologies of post-war Hollywood. On the surface, their films celebrate middle-class success, a simple American can-do attitude and, most important for this class, characters who seem to reestablish pre-war expectations of femininity and masculinity.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2531 Culture of Desire  (4 Credits),"Sex--we talk about it all the time. Talk shows, online, in magazines, in plays and music, sex shows up everywhere. Why do we expend so much energy on something that, in most cultures, isn't really discussed much in public? And what is sex, exactly? How do we define it? How do we legitimize sex, and why have we decided to categorize people as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual..? What structures have we developed to make us conform to those categories, and what discrepancies have we chosen to ignore? Why is it problematic to base arguments about relationships on historical evidence? In this course, students find out answers to these questions, answers that will lead to even more questions and problems.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2532 Death & Dying in Hindu Traditions  (4 Credits),"This course explores the meanings of death and dying in Hindu perspectives. The inevitability of death has led cultures throughout the world to speculate on what happens to the individual during, at the moment of, and after death. Until the modern period, religions have typically been the first or only place where people turned for answers to basic questions of existence: What happens at death? Will I and the people I love disappear forever? Or will we continue on after death in some way? Is this the only life we have? What is the relationship between the life we lead now and what happens at and after death?

But they have gone through major changes throughout the history since changing economic and geopolitical conditions have long challenged the international system of trade governance. This course investigates the evolution of international trade agreements as well as wars. It is about an inquiry of trade wars and agreements in the context of case studies (such as the 2018 US-China trade war) from a political economy perspective. Have the parties involved in trade been (un)fair to each other (e.g., China vs. the U.S.)? Are they (e.g., the U.S. and China) so interdependent that they must resolve trade conflicts? These questions remain valid even when countries reach a trade agreement. The course addresses those questions from the perspectives of various fields such as economics, political science, history, and cultural studies, and it illustrates the effects of trade wars on ordinary citizens.

Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2540 Culture, Media and Power  (4 Credits)","Often, films, television programs (both entertainment and journalistic), print journalism and advertising are viewed as having the inherent power to shape the individual's values and beliefs about the identity of one's self as well as that of others. The cultural studies' perspective of this course takes the position that the power to shape values about identity is not solely the providence of cultural texts, but stems from the complex intersection of media institutions, various social groups and the interpretive process. This class explores how various forms of textual, interpretive, social and economic power come to bear on the production of different kinds of cultural media texts and the range of possible meanings about identity available within them. By the end of the course, students should be able to critically analyze the links between various media texts and messages and the definition of their self-identity.",4,Unknown

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2542 Knowledge and Ignorance in Contemporary Scientific Practice  (4 Credits),"Over the last few decades, an increasing number of scientists, philosophers, historians, and sociologists have emphasized that the traditional depiction of science as a progressive accumulation of true - or approximately true - descriptions is an oversimplification. We have come to realize that the right kind of ignorance and failure can truly be a gateway to success, to deeper understanding. But how is this possible? What kind of failure can be turned into knowledge? How does science deal with ignorance? How does one use ignorance to its advantage? This course provides a long answer to these questions. Specifically, it recasts some classic philosophical issues by bringing attention to a widespread scientific practice that can be aptly called ""black-boxing."" The course examines and illustrates these issues with some prominent episodes in the history of science, from fields ranging from biology and psychology to economics. Beyond completing the Common Curriculum, there are no prerequisites for this course, which is introductory in character, presupposes no previous acquaintance with philosophy, the natural sciences, or the social sciences, and is entirely self-contained.",4,Beginner

Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2550 Music, Gender, and Sexuality  (4 Credits)","Can music express gender and sexual identities?  When a small group of scholars tenaciously raised this question in the 1990s, it created a contentious moment in the study of music history.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2557 Body & Sexuality in Religion  (4 Credits),"This course examines the unique place of the body in biblical religion. We ask how the Bible and its interpreters have shaped current views on sex and the gendered body in Western society. How has the Bible been (mis)used in relation to current understandings of the physical body? Is the saying that a ""human"" does not have a body, but is a body as true for the Hebrew Bible as the Christian New Testament? How has Judaism and Christianity (de)valued sexuality, procreation and celibacy? How do the biblical traditions shape our modern opinions about the ideal physical body and body modification? How can we understand ""out-of-body"" experiences and notions of death and afterlife in Western religion? Students are encouraged to interpret the Bible and their own beliefs from a uniquely embodied perspective.",4,Unknown

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2560 America Through Foreign Eyes  (4 Credits),"The United States, and Americans, occupy a unique, privileged and powerful position in the contemporary world order. Indeed, according to many scholarly and public accounts, the U.S. has achieved unprecedented status as the preeminent world power. Yet, despite or, paradoxically, perhaps because of its status as what some have called a world ""hyperpower,"" large numbers of Americans are mostly, if not totally unaware of what U.S. global preeminence means to them and to other people around the world. This course aims to inspire critical reflection on the student's part about the role of the United States - its political and economic systems and practices, its culture, and most fundamentally its social actors, meaning its people(s), in a globalizing world.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2562 Modern and Postmodern Music  (4 Credits),"Students explore multiple musical styles and genres, primarily from the 20th century to the present, as they develop new cognitive pathways for experiencing all music.

Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2572 Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, and Free Will  (4 Credits)","This seminar introduces students to the topic of human freedom from the perspective of philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology. If everything that you do and have ever done is the inevitable byproduct of the political, social, economic, cultural, familial, psychological, and neurological forces at work within and around you, in what sense could you be free and morally accountable for your actions? In what sense could you be worthy of praise for your accomplishments and blame for your failures?  The course will address the topic of free will using contemporary scholarship in philosophy, neuroscience, and developmental and social psychology, and we will ask questions such as:  What, exactly, is free will?  What can our understanding of causation tell us about free will?  What is moral responsibility, and how is it related to free will?  What brain processes underlie our decisions?

Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2576 Art, Thought, Spirituality  (4 Credits)","This course examines the close and complex relationship between esthetic expression and private religiosity, or ""spirituality."" The course will examine how theories as well as personal accounts of artistic creativity, experience and appreciation can both broaden and deepen our understanding of the inner life that is otherwise communicated in religious terms and how artistic expression can also have a quasi-religious or ""spiritual"" character. The central objective will be to illumine the way in which the construction of the individual self and the formation of the personal identity are intimately tied to different quests that are artistic and spiritual at once.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2577 Cultural Intersections  (4 Credits),"In this course, we explore the dynamics of cultural reception or the translational dimension of modern culture, particularly the reception of narratives within particular cultures and beyond.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2580 Celtic Identities and Nationalisms  (4 Credits),"Every March 17th, millions of people around the world engage in invented rituals of drinking, parades, & music in celebration of St. Patrick's Day.  Summer finds Scottish Highland Games enacted by kilt-wearing, bagpipe-playing, Celtic-culture aficionados across the English-speaking world.  The European Union has funded Celtic-History Trails & sites across Western Europe to link itself to an earlier period of 'unification.'  Millions of people claim Celtic heritage and ancestry in the U.S.A. and across the globe.  But what does that really mean?  Who is entitled to claim such identities?  Who is not?  How do people reconcile 'Celticness' with other elements of individual, national, and group identities across the globe? This course uses Celtic identity as a means of engaging students in a critical examination of the meaning and process of identity formation.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2582 Latina/o Identity & Community  (4 Credits),"This course analyzes the complexity of Latinos' unique social position, using a interdisciplinary approach to understand the construction, maintenance, and change of Latino identity and community formation over time in the United States. As students will learn, Latino identity in the U.S. has experienced a continual process of negotiation between dominant discourses--regarding gender, race, politics, economics and culture--and the socio-political and cultural histories of their own communities. Accordingly, we explore the variety of ways in which identity and culture are socially constructed and actively contested, with particular regard to the diversity among and within Latino groups.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2583 Individuals, Individuality, and Society  (4 Credits)","Individual"" is a key term in discussions of human life and human interaction, but it tends to be inadequately defined.  We often assume that we already all understand what an individual is.  In social science, especially, ""individual"" is typically assumed to correspond to individualism, and, particularly, to methodological individualism, the view that the individual parts making up a whole entirely and exhaustively define and determine that whole; from which it follows that each individual is to be understood as what it is in isolation, unrelated to any other individual.  This course, by contrast, starts from the claim that the question ""what is an individual?"" is genuinely difficult, and that much too little attention has been given to it.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2586 Memoirs of Madness  (4 Credits),"We examine mental illness from a literature perspective--through analysis of memoirs, and in concert with a scientific perspective--through psychological-based texts and lectures. This unique approach to study mental illness should be inherently interesting for students because of the subject matter and the chance to engage the material through personal narratives. The use of memoirs allows for a rich understanding of a variety of impairments with the added benefit of the firm anchor of clinical science.",4,Unknown

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2590 Interpreting the Holocaust Through Film  (4 Credits),"This course takes students on a journey from Nazi Germany to the present day through the lens of the camera. We examine how the Nazis used film to convey their messages, explore the varied experiences of those who lived during the time of the Holocaust as depicted in films, view movies that address various ethical dilemmas presented to Jews and Gentiles as a result of these trying times, and discuss the ways that the Holocaust has been represented and memorialized through films in more contemporary times.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2591 Latina/os in Popular Culture  (4 Credits),"This course examines trajectories of representations of Latina/o identities in popular culture (i.e. film, music, television), both produced by the dominant culture, as well as self-produced.  Students first work to understand the complexity that comprises Lainta/o communities by reading some foundational works on Latina/o identities (i.e. Gloria Anzaldua's Borderlands/La Fontera: The New Mestiza).  Following this, through a historical perspective we trace the emergence of Latina/o images in popular culture and how those images are tied to contemporary events of the time.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2594 Memory and Memorialization  (4 Credits),"This course focuses on how social groups represent, experience and commemorate the remembered past. We explore issues of construction of memory, particularly addressing issues of how the representations of the past--and its materialization through monuments, ruins and landscapes--are connected with issues of institutionalized perceptions of national, ethnic, racial and religious identity. Memory and its material representation are addressed through interdisciplinary readings and case studies from different geographical areas, and as much as possible, we use the city of Denver and Colorado as our study site to apply our observations and readings.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2596 Politics of Reconciliation  (4 Credits),"This class addresses the national and international efforts to seek justice and achieve reconciliation. It examines how state and non-state actors reflect on an unfortunate or hostile past with a designated ""other"": how did their relations and interactions with this targeted ""other"" go wrong? What were the material, philosophical and emotional grounds to breed such hostilities? What were the consequences? Has the memory of the ""past self"" and ""past others"" shaped the way the two groups interact today? Why do some actors refuse to say ""sorry,"" and why do some victims refuse to forgive? What are the similarities and differences among various reconciliation projects? In this class, we lead students to explore these challenging yet exciting questions.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2597 Unwrapping the Rhetoric of Consumption  (4 Credits),"Unwrapping the Rhetoric of Consumption: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Communication, Consumption, Shopping, and Identity is a writing intensive course that offers an introduction to the study of consumption as a communicative phenomenon.

Through research and writing, students add to the contextual breadth of the class.",4,Beginner
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2604 Russia: Revolutions & Utopias  (4 Credits),"This course examines Russian culture and society from the late 1800s to the 1930s, when Moscow and Saint Petersburg/Petrograd were synonymous with cutting-edge and avant-garde, staging revolutions--and dreaming of utopias--in politics, art, sex and science, to name but a few areas. The course compares the ideals of those times with Russia today as well as with developments in Western Europe and North America.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2605 Society, Nature and Animals  (4 Credits)","Society, Nature and Animals examines the enormously engaging and complex relationships between human communities/societies, on the one hand, and the natural world and nonhuman animals on the other. The course focuses principally, through not exclusively, on the United States, where these relationships have been imbued with special significance, and prominent political and intellectual figures have cast the country as ""nature's nation.""

Boyle, Octavia Burtler, Cormac McCarthy and others. This writing intensive course examines questions relating to environmental activism and social structures predicated upon technological and materialist culture. It considers how American writers have reassessed the relation between religious beliefs and notions of utopia and apocalypse. It examines and analyzes timely and relevant historical, literary, and philosophical issues relating to the current state of the environment.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2610 The Politics of Bilingualism  (4 Credits),"While more and more college students are required to take a “foreign” language and bilingual programs grow in popularity in the K-12 systems, formal education in languages other than English in the US has often been at the heart of fierce debates claiming it is impractical, irrelevant and even “un-American”. This course addresses a variety of concerns around the perception and manifestations of bi- and multilingual policies in the US. We examine how the perception of English as a “national language” and a “language of opportunity”, contrasted with other languages (and the people who speak them) as a “distraction” or “threat” contribute to personal and public policies surrounding language use in the US.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2611 Being Human: Sex and Sexuality  (4 Credits),"Relationships are the greatest thing in the world--until they end. Many people have experienced both the exhilaration and the misery of a romantic relationship.  The same can be true for other types of social relationships. How do you make sense of the relationships around you? To navigate better our complex human landscape, understanding the basis of human sexuality and sexual expression is important. This course examines behavior and emotion by introducing the results of high-quality scientific studies of sexual behavior and its evolution and expression.

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2615 Disease in World History  (4 Credits),"This course examines the social and political impact of disease in global history, and also considers how understandings of disease have changed over time. We will focus on the modern period (roughly the past two hundred years) and examine demographically significant diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and smallpox. Themes that we'll explore together include how the distribution of power and wealth in the 19th-20th centuries helped determine global distribution of diseases today; how our ideas about a disease influence how willing and able we are to deal with it effectively; and the notion that disease is as much as socioeconomic problem as a biotechnical one.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2616 Globalization and its Discontents  (4 Credits),"This course examines the expansion of the world economy in a comparative historical perspective and draws on the disciplines of economics, history and political science.

The course traces how these promises have been articulated by a succession of public actors ranging from U.S. Presidents to members of radical political factions.  The course always addresses three major political movements: (1) the movement for political inclusion of Blacks, beginning with early abolitionists and extending to the struggle for civil rights, including the black power movement; (2) the movement for the political inclusion of women, beginning with the suffragists and extending to include feminism, including the fights over sexual freedom; and (3) the struggle over economic rights, beginning with early U.S. socialist and anarchist movements and extending into the contest over the creation and pruning of the U.S. welfare system.",4,Beginner

Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2626 Politics, Policy and Economics of Healthcare  (4 Credits)","This course takes an intensive look at American history from 1945 to 1955 in order to investigate the 
relationship among international relations, domestic politics and American culture. While anticommunism 
was perhaps the preeminent influence over American politics and culture, this course also investigates 
other related cultural developments, such as the moral and cultural anxiety resulting from the 
revelations of the Holocaust and Stalinism, the anguish represented by the height of existentialism in 
American thought, the exploding popularity of abstract expressionism, the gradual growth of 
consumerism, and the effects of the baby boom.",4,Unknown

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2637 James Joyce's Ulysses  (4 Credits),"This Advanced Seminar will focus on James Joyce’s famously difficult—but in many ways not all that difficult—modernist masterpiece Ulysses, which will in turn be the subject of three writing assignments that will allow you to explore the roles and responsibilities of the reader, the writer, and the critic. There are many reasons to devote an entire quarter to James Joyce’s Ulysses, which turned 100 years old on 2/2/2022, but here are two: 1) its reputation as a “difficult” book often overshadows the fact that it’s beautiful, funny, and in many ways quite accessible, and 2) it’s a useful book for thinking about being with (and without) other people. In this course, we will try to find out both what this book can teach us and what we can teach one another about it.",4,Advanced
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2640 New England: Myth and Memory  (4 Credits),"The subject of this course is historical memory or, to put it simply, the relationship of the present to the past. Historians take for granted what has been called ""the invention of tradition,"" but most people do not appreciate the constructed nature of the past and do not recognize the possibility that there have been (and continue to be) contests over which version of key historical events or movements is to be disseminated to the public. This course focuses on region--New England--and its racial history as a case study of the process of fabricating historical memory. New England's history is particularly useful for this purpose because the region has had an inordinate impact on our national history.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2641 Globalization from Above and Below  (4 Credits),"This course provides a unique and challenging opportunity for students to clarify the concept of globalization by exploring parallel and interesting forces ""from above and below.""

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2643 Comparative Democratization: East and West  (4 Credits),"The purpose of this course is to examine the contested meanings of revolution and to clarify its paths and goals. To advance these purposes, this course highlights the experiences of a variety of revolutionary projects in different regions, eras and cultures. It also explores the weights that different actors (state, society, global orders, charismatic leaders, etc.) hold in shaping the processes of radical political changes. The course will conclude by exploring new thinking on the politics of revolution for the twenty-first century. We will ask how issues of ecology, gender, changing values, indigenous movements (to name just a few) can liberate our imagination about revolution in specific and political change in general in a post-modern world.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2646 Dance in India  (4 Credits),"As a discipline in which the body is trained to become ""naturalized"" in very specific ways, dance tells us much about the culture in which it is a part. Dance movements and meanings also become sites of conflict during periods of cultural transition, and yet because of dance's ephemeral nature, its relative adherence to tradition, or lack thereof, is difficult to ascertain, and thus often hotly contested. This course explores the tension between change (innovation) and continuity (tradition) in four different forms of dance from the Indian subcontinent: Bharata Natyam, a classical dance form from South India; Kathak, a classical dance form from North India; Bhangra, a folk dance form from Northwestern India; and the mass-mediated, syncretic form of dance predominant in the Bollywood film industry.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2648 Good Vibrations - Electronic Music: Technology and Culture  (4 Credits),"This course hopes to supply the answer to the question, ""How did we get here?"" To answer that question, we need to look at the phenomenon from many different perspectives. History frames the topics of the course. In order to understand characteristics of electronic instruments, we start with traditional mechanical-acoustic instruments. Their characteristics are the model for many modern electronic instruments. Although in the experimental years early in the 20th century, all traditional models of music were questioned; those included musical notation which has been in place since Charlemagne's rule in A.D. 800, the number of notes within an octave, the number of notes within a span of time, and dynamic range (loudness and softness). We look at the anatomy, physiology and perception (psychoacoustics) of human auditory response in order to frame the limits of the characteristics of electronic music and the means to produce them. Of course, the ""electronics"" are presented at a higher system level to promote understanding of the electronic instruments themselves. (NOTE: No human subjects will be harmed or subjected to any inhumane treatment by presentation of analog or digital circuits during the delivery of this course.).",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2651 The Peopling of the Western Hemisphere: Science, Evidence, Controversy  (4 Credits)","The migration and colonization of North and South America is analyzed based on data and observations made from the archaeological record. While it is evident that people did arrive in the Western Hemisphere in the distant past, there is a great deal of dispute about where they came from, when they arrived, and how they adapted to the new environments they encountered. The course evaluates various claims about all these important aspects of human migration.  It tests conflicting models about which people arrived first, where they first landed, and what they did when they got here. The primary tools for this analysis are archaeological materials, but the course also draws on recent DNA and linguistic evidence of living Native American groups.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2652 Conspiracy Theories and Contemporary Culture  (4 Credits),"What have become called ""Conspiracy Theories"" (CTs) have been around since some of the earliest human narratives but have only quite recently been studied as a distinctive phenomenon. Underlying this explosion of popular interest in CTs are a number of intriguing philosophical, psychological and socio-political issues that reveal a great deal about how social discourse is pursued, formed, circulated and empowered (or disempowered) in the contemporary world. In this course, we will view this broad phenomenon of CTs from three different perspectives: (1) philosophical, (2) psychological, (3) social and political.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2653 Law & Politics of Reproduction  (4 Credits),"This course engages issues by examining them from multiple perspectives, using analytical tools from multiple disciplines.  We explore historical and cultural changes over time, tracing them through historical and political writings, U.S. Supreme Court cases, legislation, statistical data, memoir, and sociological, philosophical and anthropological analyses.  In drawing on these multiple sources, we examine past and present while also considering the relationship of these issues to the future.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2657 Harry Potter and Esotericism  (4 Credits),"Today's students have grown up with J. K. Rowling's seven Harry Potter books. This incredible publishing phenomenon has inspired children and adults alike to devour 500-page books within days of publication, at a time when statistics seem to indicate that people are no longer reading. Why would these tales of English school children learning a curriculum of magical skills have so captured the imagination of a generation of young people living in a post-modern world?
The purpose of this class then is to examine the role of esoteric themes that pervade the Harry Potter books and to investigate the history of those subjects from the Middle Ages to the present, by focusing on the visual traditions they inspired. Areas discussed include the history of magic and witchcraft, classical and Celtic mythology, alchemy, astrology, fantastic beasts, ""books of secrets"" and their healing potions, the mythic lore of botany, divination and various esoteric paths of enlightenment.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2658 The Long Civil Rights Movement  (4 Credits),"This course explores the Long Civil Rights Movement--focusing on the ongoing struggles for racial equity in education. While the course is broadly historical in scope, covering debates about public education over the last century, it explores historical and cultural changes in education by focusing on three primary struggles: (1) the African American quest for equal education; (2) the Mexican-American fight for bilingual education; and (3) the Native American pursuit of self-determination through education. Throughout the course we consider how these historical struggles echo in contemporary debates of race, education and equity.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2660 Cinematic Storytelling  (4 Credits),"The course acquaints students with basic concepts and methods used in the analysis of stories, the theoretical assumptions and models describing and justifying those concepts and models, and practical applications of story analysis in cinematic and script form.  We begin with Aristotle, provide an interdisciplinary and historical overview of narratology, move to literary narrative analysis, and then focus on film-theoretical approaches while gaining practical skills in analysis of the elements of storytelling in fiction, film and television.  In this way, students gain some historical perspectives on the form and function of story - its timeless prevalence as well as its more current iterations.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2661 The French Revolution  (4 Credits),"This course is an interdisciplinary exploration of the French Revolution. Students learn about the many ways in which the Revolutionary decade of 1789 to 1799 marked a significant break with the French past - politically, socially and culturally. Yet these profound changes could not occur without some continuities. Students reflect upon political, sociological and philosophical questions that make the Revolution relevant today: How do democratic values take root in a traditionally monarchical society? Can these values be exported to societies without democratic traditions? Are liberty and equality compatible? How are nations defined? Can people thrive in a strictly secular--or fundamentalist--society? What is the role of violence and war in effecting political and social change?.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2662 Testimony, Memory and Allegory: the Representations of the Chinese Cultural Revolution  (4 Credits)","This course investigates how the Cultural Revolution serves as a critical link of the Revolutionary Era (1919-1980) and Reform Era (from 1980 on), via closely and critically examining various representations and surreal fiction, melodramatic and avant-garde cinema, lyric poems, music and visual arts. Although much of the material discussed is socio-politically oriented, the focus of the course is within the realm of literary and cultural criticism. This course explores complicated and often interwoven relationships between testimony, memory, signs, meanings of both writing and reading about traumatic events of the Cultural Revolution, ethical (personal and communal) commitment to memory and the engrossing historical, literary and artistic representations of the past expressed in different media. By doing so, the course reveals how each representative account copes with its producer's distinctive memories of the Cultural Revolution and, more importantly, responds to the cultural and political contingencies of the producer's time, as well as the artistic conventions of the producer. As such, it functions not only as a connection to the past but also a reconfiguration of the present.",4,Unknown

Forty years of division between West- and East-Germany--a division exacerbated by their respective geopolitical roles in the Cold War--left its mark on what many intellectuals considered a 'cultural nation' in spite of their political separation. This class examines the pains and gains of twenty years of unity, a process that has repeatedly been described as an attempt to ""normalize"" Germany's complicated history. We analyze various political, historical, but mostly cultural developments (and debates) that have accomplished and, at times, questioned this unification.",4,Unknown
Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2677 The Sixties: Swinging London  (4 Credits),"Most of us are familiar with the main images of the 1960s in Britain, miniskirts, Mods, scooters, hippies, free love, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and James Bond.  Considered the great decade of change, students' parents and other baby-boomers look back on it with nostalgia and the media continues to romanticize the period as being more innocent than today.  Yet scholars continue to argue about the degree to which the Sixties really changed British society.  While popular culture was clearly departing from that of the pre and immediately post-war era, many scholars from various disciplines assert that these changes, including the rise of the music industry, the teenager and youth culture, consumer-oriented society, spy literature, gender and racial issues found their roots in the post-war experience.  Other scholars assert that the decade was dominated by contradictory impulses and that the major changes were uneven and often on the surface.  This course traces the major themes of the period, including the rise of popular youth-based consumer culture, an unfettered media in Fleet Street, the center of world fashion-Carnaby Street, espionage literature on the page and on the screen, race and immigration issues, challenges to gender norms and sexual 'liberation', Britain's changing position in the world, the end of the British Empire, and the redefining of British national identity.  These themes are investigated using a variety of sources including popular and documentary films, personal memoirs, novels, primary documents, secondary literature, fashion, poster art and other non-traditional sources.",4,Unknown

Advanced Seminar,"ASEM 2728 Identity, Power, and Media Culture  (4 Credits)","In our contemporary cultural landscape, information is delivered in many formats, through various mediums, to global audiences. Understanding media systems as information delivery is often tied to journalism and/or financial institutions; “news” and “data,” have become synonymous with what we officially learn from media culture. However, those same images and messages that help us understand our social condition are also delivering important meanings about ourselves and those around us. This course focuses on this branch of inquiry within media studies—highlighted by the work of cultural studies—and focuses on the intersections of identity and power. As a fundamental source of the signification of identity, media culture becomes a social tool, and therefore must be understood as a system that shapes our relationships to individuals and communities. This course will explore the importance of this process, will equip students with the means to critically analyze media texts and production, and will sharpen awareness to dominant norms and values in our society. Overall, this course provides students an opportunity to directly confront the questions: How do media shape our understandings of intersecting identities such as gender, race, ability and class? How can we critically identify stereotypes and misrepresentation, including our own privilege? How do dynamics of identity operate at the production level(s)?

Advanced Seminar,ASEM 2739 Can College Teach Reasoning?  (4 Credits),"In the last several years, colleges and universities have made national news with a series of controversies over diversity, inclusivity, and free speech. Many commentators see free speech at odds with diversity and inclusivity. Those who stress the importance of free speech on campus often embrace an idea with a long philosophical history: the “thinking cure.” According to this line of thinking, a principal task of education— particularly higher education—is to teach critical thinking. A well-functioning university (not to mention a well- functioning democracy) is a marketplace of ideas where participants are free to rationally debate the issues of the day. The best ideas will eventually win out. People need the skills to debate rationally, which education should provide, and the freedom to deploy those skills in arguing for their versions of the true and the good, which educational institutions and the courts should protect. This course aims to understand and critically analyze this line of thinking through the lens of philosophy, empirical psychology, and contemporary journalism. Can we really be trained to reason in the way that this line of thinking requires? The course considers arguments that emphasize the limitations on our ability to reason, arguments that we are frequently subject to (sometimes insuperable) biases. We examine how these arguments bear on the aims of education generally, and on free speech provisions in particular.",4,Unknown

We will draw from various thematic and transnational contexts across the Americas and Native Pacific in order to analyze the scope and significance of such knowledges, particularly as they relate to broader theories and practices of decolonization. We will begin by examining the foundational inquiries and methods of Indigenous feminist scholarship. Is gender a useful category of analysis? How have Indigenous women thought of gender? How have Indigenous women thought about, and responded to, feminism? With an emphasis on Indigenous scholars and feminists, we will cover a range of topics including (but not limited to) how Indigenous feminism fits into the feminist project, the connection between colonization and violence against Native women, the reclamation of women’s initiations, gender and sovereignty, queer indigeneity, Indigenous feminist allies, and decolonial love. We will draw from readings across feminist movements, and as feminist Kanaka Maoli Professor Lani Teves says, we will attempt to “make links between Indigenous feminisms and Latinx feminisms, Black feminisms, and transnational feminisms.

Arabic,ARAB 1351 Tales from the Arabian Nights: Reading across Time and Space  (4 Credits),"No doubt that through their magical transformations and marvelous plots, the stories of the Arabian Nights, also known as One Thousand and One Nights, have a great entertainment value and that the imaginary setting of the tales has fascinated and inspired many authors and artists. However, this collection of stories has also significantly contributed to how the West views the Middle East: an exotic world populated by negative images such as conniving and manipulating harem women and violent and unscrupulous Arab men. The Tales of the Arabian Nights provide a unique platform for the discussion of current issues such as orientalism, stereotyping, and gender discrimination. In this course, we will select a handful of stories to serve as a catalyst for inquiry to show how this shared narrative passed on from generation to generation, has contributed to the creation of an ‘exotic’ East invented by the colonial West. We will show that the Middle East, like the rest of the world, is in a state of flux and the text is not a historical account of the medieval Arab world and cannot be viewed a-historically. We will unveil all the stereotypes that have been subtly, or not so subtly, implanted in the mind of the west through an often-erroneous portrayal of the Arab world.

As such, communication scholars--particularly those concerned with the art of public persuasion--are in a unique position to contribute to this significant and complex issue. In the words of climate scientists Susanne Moser and Lisa Dilling, ""We need to open up the communication process to a wider community, in which participants own the process and content of communication.""

In particular we will ask if the justifications of free speech need to be rethought given our understanding of speech as a social force that constitutes identities and values rather than merely expressing private opinions. Moreover, given our understanding of the social force of speech, should we regulate speech that is racist, sexist and seems to erode the foundations of a public culture based on mutual respect and public deliberation over social goods? Can we devise a robust defense of free speech based on its social force that both protects those that may be harmed by antidemocratic discourses and still provides the resources for democratic dissent?.",4,Unknown

Critical Race & Ethnic Studies,"ETHN 2102 1492: Indigeneity, Settler Colonialism, Race  (1-2 Credits)","The year 1492 inaugurated a profoundly destructive phase in the history of humanity, but more so for the Indigenous peoples of this hemisphere as Christopher Columbus arrived at the shores of the “New World.” Within a couple of centuries after his arrival, thriving Indigenous civilizations found themselves in dire straits, if not completely laid to waste, causing untold suffering to the original inhabitants of this continent. The waves of European settlers who followed Columbus not only forcefully settled Indigenous lands by dispossessing Native peoples, but enforced a series of spiritual, cultural, social, political, and economic changes that had devastating effects on Indigenous lifeways. Yet, Indigeneity continues to not only thrive but challenges the ongoing disruption caused by settler-colonial occupation of lands and lives. This course, which is the first of a three-part sequence, takes Indigeneity and its repression by settler-colonialism as a foundational structure that inaugurated other projects of global consequence, including (anti)Black slavery and European colonization of the “Old World.” While Indigeneity is an international concept, our focus in this class will be on New World Indigeneity, especially North America. We will approach settler colonialism not as a thing of the past but as an ongoing incursion into the lives of Indigenous people, who continue to challenge it in new and innovative ways.",2,Unknown
Critical Race & Ethnic Studies,ETHN 2202 1619: Slavery and Its Afterlives  (1-2 Credits),"The year 1619 marked the arrival of the first slave ship on the shores of what would come to be known as the United States of America. In August of that year, an English ship reached Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula where 20 Black people were sold for food and other essentials. This event inaugurated what would soon become a foundational institution of the New World—anti-Black chattel slavery—which undergirded all aspects of life in the U.S. Even though slavery had existed in many forms and in many places across the globe, what the U.S. model of slavery succeeded in doing was linking slavery with Blackness. This made slavery an inescapable part of Blackness, ensuring that whoever was born Black was also born into slavery. The celebrated theorist Toni Morrison has called slavery “America’s original sin.” Although slavery was formally abolished through the Emancipation Proclamation issued on Jan 1, 1863, it has continued to structure contemporary Black life, which the theorist Saidiya Hartman has termed the “aftermaths of slavery.” In other words, for critical Black theorists such as Hartman, slavery never ended but transformed into other structures that continue to render Black lives disposable. This class embraces Hartman’s understanding of slavery as an institution that has survived in (c)overt forms, as critical to understanding contemporary issues faced by Black people.",2,Unknown
Critical Race & Ethnic Studies,ETHN 2302 1848: Settler Colonialism to Settler Imperialism  (1-2 Credits),"Description: 1848 marked the signing of the Treaty of Guadalope-Hidalgo between the U.S. and Mexico. Apart from ending the U.S.-Mexico war, the treaty forced Mexico to cede about half of its territory, including present-day states of Texas as well as California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, parts of Colorado, and many other states. This makes it one of the largest land grabs in human history. More importantly, this treaty facilitated the westward expansion of settlers, leading to new forms of racial antagonisms while escalating existing ones. This class approaches this moment as also marking the emergence of the U.S. as an imperialist superpower on the world stage as its war making, which was hitherto focused exclusively on Indigenous groups, would now be expanded to new terrains and increasingly outside the New World. We will also pay attention to how colonial expropriation and racialization of Indigenous and Black people would provide the grammar that the U.S. would use as it encountered racial others both within its newly established but unstable borders as well as across the world. In sum, this class will explore different antagonisms that comprise the ""cacophony of empire"" (Byrd, 2011) and how racialized groups have fought back as well as remained complicit in reinscribing the supremacy of the U.S.",2,Unknown

Economics,ECON 1020 Economics: A Critical Introduction  (4 Credits),"The course gives students a critical understanding of basic economic concepts, showing the importance of differences in the understanding of these concepts by different economic theories: the theories differ both in their view of the economy and its place in society; and in the potential impact of their policy recommendations on different individuals and social groups. The course begins with the immediate experience of life in the “new economy”; and then frames a critical analysis of this experience, drawing out three themes: the relation of the economy to public and private life; inequality and discrimination; globalization. The critical framework calls for a historical dimension: how did we get here? It also points to a defining feature not only of the “new economy”, but of the modern, capitalist economy since its origins: capitalism generates periodic crises within itself. The most obvious crisis is the “economic” one, but equally important are the crises of inequality and discrimination, and of environmental sustainability. The course concludes by considering what kind of economic order, what agents and institutions, would be required to transform capitalism into a socially and ecologically sustainable system.

Economics,ECON 2101 Urban Economic History Through Cinema  (4 Credits),"We have recently passed the threshold where more than half of the population globally is living in urban areas. Perhaps more striking is that in 1850 only 3 cities (London, Beijing and Paris) had populations that exceeded a million people, while today there are over 300 such cities, with the largest city, Tokyo, having nearly 40 million inhabitants. Coincidentally, the growth in urban areas coincided with the emergence of cinema. In the popular imagination cities have been sites of both promise and terror and this has been well captured in movies since the early 20th century. This course will consider the economic cycle of cities from the early 20th century to the present as seen through film representations. While the films we will watch are works of art this is not a course on film appreciation. What we are interested in is how the emergence of large clusters of people living together in relatively small areas is being depicted over time. Furthermore, we want to understand how the economic arrangements that define these clusters, these cities, are documented and provide a new way of thinking about how humans decide to live and work in common spaces.",4,Unknown
Economics,ECON 2190 Behavioral Economics  (4 Credits),"Economics as a discipline often assumes people are rational and self-interested. Yet, when we look at the world around us, we see these assumptions violated, or at least they appear to be violated. In a course on Behavioral Economics, common economic assumptions are relaxed to allow for some behaviors that consistently appear in reality, such as over-optimism, procrastination, altruism, spite, …, that standard economic theory has difficulty explaining. In this course we will identify common “irrationalities” in the lives of well-loved characters from literature or film, analyze our own behavior and that of the world around us, propose experiments to test for “anomalous” behaviors and their causes, design models to capture experimental findings, as well as discuss policies to encourage/discourage common human behaviors.

And how have their reflections shaped the way we think about power and inequality today? Apart from writers frequently taught in courses on British literature, we will also read British authors who are, ironically, often not classified under “British” (such as Mary Prince, an abolitionist born a slave in Bermuda, and Mary Seacole, also a woman of color, who traveled widely and served as a military nurse during the Crimean War).

English,ENGL 3707 Posthumanism  (4 Credits),"As the term ""posthumanism"" suggests, the consideration of what may come ‘after’ or exist ‘beyond’ the conventional understanding of what it means to be human lies at the center of this emergent critical perspective. The literary and philosophic engagement with the complicated set of ideas around these questions call for a reevaluation of the notion of the corporeal human subject and a reconsideration of the limits of the human mind. Posthuman thought shifts the focus to a consideration of the ways in which embodiment and thinking are positioned in relation to technological advancements in fields as disparate as robotics, cybernetics, and artificial intelligence to bioengineering and genetics. Given the issues under consideration, ideas emerging from sci-fi, speculative fiction, cyberpunk and contemporary philosophy have long been at the center of posthumanism, while also reflecting in classic works from Pliny’s Historia Naturalis, Julien Offray de La Mettrie's L'homme Machine (Man a Machine) and May Shelley’s Frankenstein, as well. Drawing on such a discursive foundation of works from around the world, our primary focus will be on texts produced by writers, thinkers and artists who best expand the possibilities and questions at the center of posthumanism, including Karel Čapek, Isaac Asimov, Stanisław Lem, Philip K. Dick, William Gibson and Shirow Masamune and Kazuo Ishiguro, with Hajime Sorayama, Donna J. Haraway, Manuel De Landa and N. Katherine Hayles.

French,FREN 2301 Capitalism vs. Socialism: Emile Zola  (4 Credits),"This course analyzes the complex interrelationship between the economic ideologies and practices of capitalism and socialism in the works of the nineteenth-century French novelist Émile Zola. Three novels in which these themes are a major driving force of the action will be studied. In the first, Germinal, the capitalist system is viewed from the outside by poor, oppressed workers who feel victimized by it. In the second novel, Money, the author delves into capitalism at its very heart, the Stock Exchange of Paris. He explores all its machinations but also shows the growing cracks in the system as socialist protestations make inroads at the top. The third work, The Ladies Paradise, proposes a possible reconciliation of capitalism and socialism, inspired in part by the writings of French socialist thinkers earlier in the century. In a new era department store, workers’ rights and commercial profit are seen to be mutually beneficial. This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement.",4,Unknown

French,FREN 2303 Victor Hugo: Les Misérables and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame  (4 Credits),"The course deals with two famous novels by Victor Hugo: Les Misérables and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.
Though written in the nineteenth century, these works explore themes that are relevant in contemporary society, like racism, sexism, injustice, marginalization, and poverty. Les Misérables is the story of a man, Jean Valjean, a victim of social injustice who redeems himself to become a generous humanitarian, saving himself and everyone around him. This novel explores many social issues and calls out for reform. Discrimination against women and their mistreatment by a paternalistic system is a major theme. The inhuman exploitation of the poor, the homeless, and the marginalized is another major subject. This exploitation can lead to extreme suffering for some people and to criminal behavior for others. Hugo emphasizes the influence of the spiritual in human life. Individuals, even emperors like Napoleon, are invited in different ways to respond to divine love, but some are more able to do so than others. Hugo wrote The Hunchback of Notre-Dame to inspire the French public to save the famous cathedral, almost destroyed recently, from demolition back in the 1830s. He tells the story of Esmeralda, a beautiful, kindhearted, and talented young woman, who is a victim of discrimination and persecution because she is a woman and a person of color. She is loved by four men, each of whom contributes, wittingly or unwittingly, to her ultimate destruction. The cathedral itself and the Blessed Lady for whom it is named (Our Lady of Paris) are also major characters. The author shows that the same injustices, inequalities, and prejudices that he tried to combat in his own time already existed in the Middle Ages.

Geography,GEOG 3120 Environmental/GIS Modeling  (4 Credits),"Facing challenges brought by the dramatically changing global environment, environmental modeling is increasingly used to support geographical and environmental decision making (e.g., spatial conservation prioritization). Environmental modeling is concerned with the characterization, modeling and simulation of environmental phenomena and processes using conceptual and mathematical models. Environmental phenomena and processes taking place in the geographic space are regulated by spatial principles. They also interact with other phenomena or processes in the attribute space. For example, species distribution is not only constrained by spatial factors such as proximity to other species, but also influenced by environmental factors such as terrain and climatic conditions. Due to its superior capabilities of handling spatial data and modeling spatial and attribute relationships, geographic information system (GIS) provides the ideal tools for environmental modeling.  This upper-level undergraduate/graduate-level course surveys the concepts and techniques of GIS supported environmental modeling in three general categories: 1) Modeling in the spatial domain where the focus is on modeling spatial principles (e.g., spatial autocorrelation); 2) Modeling in the attribute domain where the emphasis is on environmental correlations (e.g., environmental niche modeling); 3) Modeling in the combined spatial and attribute domain where both spatial principles and environmental correlations are exploited (e.g., geographically weighted regression).

Geography,GEOG 3825 Geographies of International Development in Africa  (4 Credits),"What are the historical roots of (under)development in sub-Saharan Africa? How is sub- Saharan Africa typically depicted in the media? How can we explain the fact that the Niger Delta provides the bulk of Nigeria’s revenue, and yet, it remains the poorest part of the country? Is climate change the major cause of persistent food insecurity in the drylands of Ethiopia and Burkina Faso? How can we make sense of the uneven geography of poverty in Ghana? What explains urban food insecurity in Cape Town, or land struggles in rural South Africa? What are the social processes underlying the spatial disparity in health status in Malawi, or gender differences in HIV rates in Nyanza province, Kenya? And why do land users often resist state conservation efforts in Tanzania? These are some of the critical questions explored in this course. The primary aim is to provide a critical introduction to the geography of sub-Saharan Africa. We will begin by exploring how “the Africa story” is told by the media, scholars and policymakers.

History,"HIST 2885 Migration, Mobility, and Movement in Africa  (4 Credits)","This course will span the precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial eras of African history to consider narratives of historical migration within and beyond the continent. Central to these narratives are ideas of indigeneity and foreignness, firstcomer and newcomer status, articulated in the colonial and postcolonial period as differences of race and ethnicity. Through this course, students will be introduced to the historiography of migration in Africa, as well as theories and methodologies based on linguistics, oral traditions, and archaeology. We will begin with the Bantu expansion patterns of second millennium BCE up to 1500 CE, considering the linguistic trajectory that this migration took in considering the origins of modern language groups on the continent.

Each week, we will look at the history of a different sport, including cricket, tennis, soccer, golf, rugby, and hockey, and explore the intersection of race, class, and gender in how these sports were played and transformed in the imperial world. We will consider the ways in which sport was used not only as an element of the racialized “civilizing” mission of imperial ventures, but also how sport was coopted by indigenous populations to resist colonial structures of segregation and oppression. This class will ask us to reconsider the intersections and divergences in the way sports are both played and viewed by national sporting teams, local leagues and schools, and transmitted to audiences through live viewing, television, radio, and other forms of media. We will also look at the representations of sports and colonialism through films, fiction, and television shows. Finally, we will analyze the postcolonial legacies of colonial sporting cultures after decolonization, looking at the ways in which countries in the global south have taken over transnational leagues and institutions to make what were once colonial and European-dominated sporting cultures their own.",4,Unknown

History,HIST 3275 The Past and Afterlives of Apartheid  (4 Credits),"In 1948, after a close election, a government founded on the platform of apartheid, or a radical form of racial segregation, came into power in South Africa. Apartheid as a system remained in place until 1994. This seminar delves into the roots and trajectory of apartheid, and considers its effects on the lives of South Africans. As a 3000-level topics course, the readings for this course will be interdisciplinary, but will be founded in historical methodology and process, while also considering representations of apartheid and the history of South Africa through mediums such as literature, film, music, and sports. While the origins and institutions of apartheid will be studied, as well as the history of South African nationalist and resistance movements, one of the goals of this course will be to look at the lives of ordinary South Africans, and how they resisted the apartheid state in more quotidian ways. This course will also focus on the moment of 1994 and the legacy of apartheid in South Africa’s postcolonial future, one in which the ideal of a rainbow nation was disrupted by the persistence of structural inequality and the memories of violence brought up by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. We will also explore the comparative literature between apartheid South Africa and Jim Crow in the United States, considering the transnational implications of institutions of white supremacy and the legacy of British colonialism and white nationalism across the globe, as well as the fight against apartheid led by the independent nations of the global south in the United Nations.",4,Unknown

In this course we will examine the world of the Vikings, looking at the social, cultural, and political changes that the Viking Age ushered in not just in Scandinavia but across Europe.

In 1500, for instance, it was a well-known fact that women are sexually voracious creatures who needed strict control to keep their appetites in check; by 1800, it was an equally well-known fact that women are inherently chaste and modest. The ideal male in 1500 was someone who used violence to maintain his authority; in 1800, masculinity was about self-discipline and politeness. In this course, we explore changing ideas about femininity and masculinity in the early modern period and consider how those changes related to broader shifts in culture and society.",4,Unknown
History,HIST 3350 Social History-Modern Britain  (4 Credits),"This course investigates the intersections of class, gender, and race in nineteenth-century British society. During this period, Britain became the preeminent world power thanks to its spectacular industrialization and its even more impressive empire. Such success often fostered smugness and complacency, yet British society was also riddled with dissension as people struggled to cope with the enormous changes they were witnessing. Discussions focus on the ways in which Victorian people themselves understood their society and its problems, and how they attempted to construct solutions to those problems. Who was implicitly or explicitly excluded from British society? As we consider these topics, we use a variety of secondary and primary sources, including fiction; one goal of the course is for us to think about how to integrate different kinds of sources as we analyze historical problems and create our own interpretations. Cross listed with MUAC 3350.",4,Unknown

History,HIST 3375 Empire: Revolt and Repression  (4 Credits),"This seminar examines imperialism through case studies of European powers' repression of anti-colonial revolts. We study, for example, the case of Algeria, which gained independence from France in 1962 after a brutal war of independence. We discuss the establishment and nature of the empire in the mid-nineteenth century, the moderate decolonization movement beginning in the early twentieth century, and the radical revolt of the 1950s that prompted the French to use torture in counter-terrorism operations.  This case study also is relevant to post-9/11 U.S. foreign policy, when the George W. Bush administration was widely condemned for its use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" at Guantanamo Bay and other detention sites. Facing criticism from around the world, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld studied the history of French operations in Algeria and the French response to allegations of human rights abuses. In light of this recent history, we examine the lessons that the history of French Algeria teaches us about war, terrorism and counter-terrorism in our own times.",4,Unknown

History,HIST 3455 Living Dangerously: Hazards and Disasters in American History  (4 Credits),"Monster storms, deadly pandemics, climatic doomsday scenarios, tragic accidents like the Titanic: our news, popular culture, and national nightmares are filled with imagery of disasters. They make for upsetting and almost irresistibly gripping stories, but the stories too often fall into cheap sensationalism, simplistic morality tales, and other clichés. In this seminar, sweeping from pre-Columbian calamities to Hurricane Katrina, covid, and the climate disasters of our own time, we’ll move past the clichés to consider the historical significance of disasters in America: how they’ve disrupted people’s lives, but also reshaped ideas of what’s “natural” or “normal.” We’ll ask: what roles have humans played in “natural” disasters like floods, droughts, wildfires, and earthquakes? How have Americans tried to guard against environmental hazards, and what unintended consequences—including new kinds of disasters—have resulted from these efforts? We’ll also study why some people are more vulnerable than others, and how environmental hazards and disasters have helped shape social inequality. Disaster history not only sheds new light on America’s past, but also intertwines it with environmental questions that are literally matters of life and death—so the class welcomes students of history, environmental studies, sustainability, politics and public policy, geography, and other fields too.",4,Unknown

History,HIST 3650 Native Crude: Indigenous Oil Politics and Activism  (4 Credits),"The extraction and development of oil resources is one of the central issues driving U.S. geopolitical policy in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. As the U.S. government engages in covert and overt overseas incursions in order to secure oil supply, we have also reevaluated our domestic supply priorities. Both these dynamics-- as well as the work by multinational oil companies to continually explore and develop/exploit new oil resources-- have led to fraught negotiations between states, multinational corporations, and indigenous populations across the globe.

History,HIST 3680 The Strange History of American Suburbia  (4 Credits),"Everyone knows the emblems of American suburbia: single-family houses with attached garages, grassy lawns, curving streets and cul-de-sacs, office parks and shopping malls. But there's a history behind these settings that's poorly understood - that that is key to understanding much about the U.S. Suburbia sheds light on American popular attitudes toward nature, technology, health, politics, and patriotism, and on the complicated dynamics of race, gender, family, class, and religion in American society. In this course, we explore how the U.S. became a ""suburban nation,"" from the Romantic retreats of the nineteenth century, through suburbia’s triumphant yet troubled ""golden age"" in the 1950s, to the stereotype-shattering suburbs of own time. We consider the surprisingly powerful ways suburbia history has shaped U.S. history more broadly.",4,Unknown

International LLC,ILLC 2100 Globalization: A View from Costa Rica  (4 Credits),"Globalization"" is a widely used word these days; however, there is little agreement on what it means. The diverse use of ""globalization"" may range from utopian to dystopian, from a losing proposition for some to the winning streak for the others, from the ""civilizing power of free markets"" to the ""barbarism of state-controlled markets,"" from clash of civilizations to cosmopolitan ethics, from universally accepted values to honoring unique beliefs cherished by individuals, from protecting the rights of smaller countries to embracing a global order of a world government, from euphoric optimism to debilitating pessimism, from a melting pot of cultures to a loss of cultural identity--the list goes on and on. For all practical purposes though, globalization can be defined as the intensification of economic, political, legal, social and cultural interconnectedness across international borders (Paul, Roy and Mukhopadhyay, Journal of International Marketing, 2006). In this course, we examine this definition of globalization firsthand, by visiting Costa Rica. Costa Rica provides a perfect opportunity for studying the phenomenon of globalization. It is a close, sage and friendly country, yet quite different from the U.S. We learn about the similarities and dissimilarities in cultural, political, legal, social public policy, and economic systems that exist between Costa Rica and the U.S. We investigate the impact of globalization in Costa Rica and compare that with our experience in the U.S. Course activities include visits to local businesses, service learning projects with local schools and environmental groups, and guest speeches by government officials.",4,Unknown

International Studies,INTS 2160 Labor in the Global Political Economy  (4 Credits),"This course explores and examines the role of labor in different parts of the global economy. According to world systems theory (Wallerstein et al.), there is a global division of labor into three zones: (1) core (essentially the wealthier, high-tech, highly industrialized economies), (2) periphery (generally, but not always those that provide basic food stuffs and unprocessed raw materials to the richer countries), and (3) what is referred to the 'semi-periphery' (countries that have elements of both the core and the periphery, which tend to be 'in the middle' economically, so to speak). In each of these three zones of the global economy, labor tends to function in quite different ways in terms of wages and working conditions, technical pre-conditions (education of the work force), etc. In a similar light, many manufactured products today are not made in one place, but are the products of this global division of labor. Often one part of the manufacturing process begins in one zone, but the refining and final manufacture takes place somewhere else - making the process truly global. The global division of labor is made possible by increasingly cheap transportation costs and cheap sources of energy. Consequently, the course examines the processes of the global division of labor, how it seems to influence global production and its fundamental dynamism (but also instability), as production moves from one part of the world to another.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2180 Politics of Development  (4 Credits),"This course seeks to answer an overarching question that plagues development studies: why are some countries poor while other countries are rich? Furthermore, we ask why poverty is persistent around the world, and how the economic, political, and social structures of a society can improve conditions of poverty within a country. We begin answering these questions by reviewing the history of development, especially development conceived since the 1950s, when the post-war world saw a need to rebuild societies in Europe, up to the present time, when human development became the focus in the decade following the end of the Cold War. The course covers the major documents promoting theories of development, as well as looks at the historical record of the implementation of development policies (noting the divergence between theory and practice). We consider specific case studies in the process of asking why some countries are poor and others are rich, Furthermore, we are concerned with the role of country policies and implementation practices, with the impact of international organizations (multilateral development organizations), and the influence of bilateral foreign aid, on development progress or decline within countries.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2181 Culture and Identity in World Politics  (4 Credits),"How can a cartoon represent both humor and disdain? How can it become a symbol for freedom of speech and a trigger for violence? As events in recent years in Paris, Ukraine, Guinea and the US show, the symbolic importance attached to actions and artifacts vary and trigger different responses. This course will examine how culture and identity influence the perception of world issues and reactions to them. We will look at the construction of meaning and its impact on priorities and political action. We will also explore power dynamics and political voice.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2218 Intelligence Analysis and the U.S. Policymaking Process  (4 Credits),"This course will provide an overview of the intelligence collection and analysis cycles, as well as the national security policymaking process. It will examine case studies in which both the perceptions and biases of analysts or policymakers resulted in intelligence failures, and discuss ways to avoid those misperceptions and counter biases. The course will conclude with a short simulation in which students will each play a member of the National Security Council, debating over the pros and cons of an important foreign policy decision.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2235 Gender and International Relations  (4 Credits),"How does gender shape international relations (IR)? How do ideas about masculinity and femininity affect war and peace? The global economy? Migration? Foreign policy? What do feminist perspectives contribute to the study of IR? These questions have relevance for the academic study of IR as well as the lived experiences of people around the world. Answering them requires attending to the ways in which gender and aspects of sexuality are constructed through social and political relations, and the hierarchies of power they reflect and maintain.   Overall, this course encourages students to grapple with the issue of if and how gender matters in international relations. We will begin by introducing the concepts and theories necessary to investigate, research, analyze, and understand the gendered nature of international relations. Next, we will use this knowledge to compare gendered and feminist perspectives on IR to mainstream IR and explore why they have not been fully integrated. Then we will engage in gendered analyses of a variety of topics in IR, focusing especially on security and the economy. We will finish by carrying out research on a topic of our choosing, using the lenses and tools we have developed. In the end, students should consider whether this sort of perspective provides a more nuanced and holistic way of understanding IR.",4,Beginner
International Studies,INTS 2275 Climate Breakdown  (4 Credits),"We live in a time when the planet is undergoing great stress and strain. Multiple global environmental problems are pushing us to the precipice, but few people address the scope and scale of the problem. Clearly, the planet is undergoing powerful changes, much of it due to human activity. Indeed, this is exactly what we mean when we say we are now living in the Anthropocene epoch, where human activity has significantly altered the Earth. However, as complex the problems facing humanity are, a very simple question arises: Will humanity have enough time to turn away from going over the cliff and become sustainable? Although it is impossible to answer that question with any certainty, we have a much better chance of discovering an answer by realizing two basic components of the problem: 1) planetary stability, and 2) the planet as a system. This class distills the complex relationship between human activities and planet stability by understanding what planetary boundaries are and what it means when we push past them.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2293 Democracy and Militarism in Latin America  (4 Credits),"Many note that even as democratization has taken place throughout Latin America, there has been a persistent and evolving role for the military, police, and private security forces in many cases. The purpose of the class is to explore this apparent contradiction by examining the various internal and external pressures that have come to bear on these societies. Through approaches derived from comparative politics and international political economy we study domestic factors such as interest groups, political parties, social movements, and governing institutions on one hand, and the role of international relations and organizations on the other.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2370 Globalization and the Knowledge Economy  (4 Credits),"Much has been made of a new “knowledge economy” in which human capital has ascended to prominence over the traditional components of capital and labor.  Further, the concept of “economic globalization” captures the realities of increasing interactions but exaggerates the notion of a single world economy connecting all producers, distributors, and consumers. In this class we examine the meaningful yet variable processes of increased knowledge diffusion and economic interaction to identify clusters of innovation, indicative of the knowledge economy. We then assess the applicability of globalization on a sector/ industry basis to identify ongoing transformations and future implications for knowledge development.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2377 War in Ukraine  (4 Credits),"The war in Ukraine is a tragedy for all who are impacted. It is also a critical political/strategic event of the early 21st century and an insight into how political violence and the reactions/responses it provokes play out in a globalized world. Given we, sadly, cannot wish away war however defined, it is important to understand how/why this war started (the past), how/why it is playing out the way it is (the present), and what might happen going forward both specifically in the case of the Ukraine-Russia War/conflict and in other potential cases of future state level political violence (the future).
As we are all citizens of states/societies confronting how to respond to threats to peace, our states/societies, and the world we live in, the war in Ukraine is a critical case study we can learn from and test our knowledge and preferences against in real time. Only in this way can we think seriously about the realities of political violence, international/global politics and strategic practice, and the humanitarian, social, economic, political, and physical costs that stem from war in a global age.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2380 Comparative Development Strategies  (4 Credits),"Why do people in some countries have so much, while people in other countries lack basic necessities? This course explores the field of development economics, exploring the challenges improving quality of life in poor countries. We look at national-level indicators and explore theories of aggregate economic growth.

International Studies,"INTS 2440 Women, War, and Peace  (4 Credits)","Conflict is gendered: it both shapes and is shaped by the gendered roles people play in society. Traditionally, men fight while women play supportive roles, men are perpetrators of violence while women are victims of this violence. However, this simple story is not only inaccurate, it limits our capacity to identify and analyze the full range of activities that men and women pursue during conflict. This story encourages us to valorize the warrior man and condemn men as cowards who will not take up arms. This story encourages us to expect women to be the victim and to ignore or treat as aberrant women who are perpetrators of violence themselves. This story also ignores the reality that the male/female dichotomy does not represent the full continuum of gender expression. The processes of peace-building are similarly gendered as it is elites who sit down to discuss the cessation of violence and design peace agreements and these are nearly always men who fight. Post-conflict environments are structured by peace agreements. When agreements are written by particular men, institutions and social structures tend to maintain the same kinds of gender bias that existed during conflict. This class will explore a range of issues guided by the question: how are conflict and post-conflict processes gendered?.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2468 Resolving Conflict by Negotiation  (4 Credits),"Social conflict is a national and global issue often expressed in violent ways culminating in shootings, civil war, and international terrorism. It is easier to escalate conflict than diffuse it, and easier to fight rather than negotiate, situations that often lead to frustration and insecurity for disputants. This course examines approaches and mechanisms of conflict resolution within the context of personal, cultural, and political barriers to understand why parties continue to fight or manage to solve their differences through settlement and reconciliation, and teaches techniques of conflict resolution, essential skills for progress and prosperity in the modern world.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2470 Crime & International Politics  (4 Credits),"What constitutes a crime in one location may constitute a personal right, a survival strategy or legitimate business opportunity in another.

Topics include corruption, the drug trade, and human trafficking.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2490 Introduction to Global Health  (4 Credits),"This class is an introduction to the field of global health and explores relationships between social, political, cultural, and economic conditions of mostly low and middle-income countries and their impact on health and health services.  We will spend some time covering health issues in high-income countries as well.  A major focus of the course is the evolution of primary health care and alternative strategies in global health.  Topics addressed include: maternal and child health, nutrition, the rise of non-communicable diseases, water and sanitation, community engagement, global health agencies, and funding sources.  The course presents an overview of the multiple factors that influence global health and emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to global health challenges.",4,Beginner
International Studies,INTS 2565 Debates On Democracy  (4 Credits),"This course will cover a range of questions and issues related to the contemporary practice of democracy around the world. We will begin the course by briefly addressing questions about how to study democracy, including definitions and measurement. We will then turn to the question of why some countries adopt and practice democracy, while many others remain under authoritarian systems of rule, paying special attention to why and how democracy is apparently under increasing threat in some parts of the world. The second part of the course will assess issues of governance – why and how democracies do (or do not) effectively address the security, economic, environmental, and social needs of their populations. The third part of the course will address emerging challenges for democratic systems of government such as changes in information technology, migration and the management of diversity, and globalized capitalism.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2590 U.S.-Russia Relations  (4 Credits),"This course combines study of Russia’s history, political geography, and ethno-national composition, and political institutions to examine U.S.-Russia relations, with an emphasis on the period from the end of the Cold War to the present. We will focus on the issues around Russia's societal collapse at the end of communism in East and Central Europe, its post-Communist transition, U.S.-Russian cooperation, American and European democracy promotion efforts, Russia’s response to EU and NATO expansion, Russia's determination of its foreign-policy interests, its interference in the domestic affairs of former Soviet Republics (its so-called ""near abroad""), and other sovereign nations.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2595 Political Risk and International Politics  (4 Credits),"Political risk has risen in both scale and relevance since the start of the 21st Century to become a vital tool for policymakers, military planners, and global business leaders to chart a course forward. This course will provide you with an introduction to this exciting and growing discipline, introducing concepts like scenario analysis, field reporting skills, forecasting, and other tools of the risk consulting industry to familiarize you with this evolving practice area.
We will explore how modern governments, NGOs, and multinational businesses factor risk into the decision-making process. We live at a time of great geopolitical transition and risk lurks around every corner. From the War in Ukraine to the debate over climate change to gyrating interest rates and energy prices, there has never been a more important moment to understand how to integrate risk into your thinking.",4,Beginner
International Studies,INTS 2605 Nuclear Weapons in International Security  (4 Credits),"What role do nuclear weapons play in international politics? Why do states develop nuclear weapons? How are these weapons used in different crises? This course is an introduction to different themes in nuclear politics. The course will introduce students to the history of nuclear weapons, theories of nuclear deterrence, crises, non-proliferation, and disarmament. We will examine the nuclear weapons choices of different states, including those who have developed nuclear weapons, and those which have chosen to give them up. We will also assess if the international nuclear non-proliferation regime has been successful in attempting to spread nuclear weapons. The course will train students to pay attention to theoretical debates on nuclear weapons and how they speak to policy considerations and assess these arguments using historical empirical evidence. The course will also use these tools to assess current nuclear challenges with regard to U.S.-China competition, and the different crises involving North Korea, Iran, Russia, India, and Pakistan.",4,Beginner
International Studies,INTS 2667 Illicit Markets  (4 Credits),"This course explores the relation between illicit networks, security, and the state in the global economy. We study the links between what is considered formal and informal, and legal and illegal, to examine what official views obscure in the everyday relations of transnational activities. The material largely examines illegal practices from the ground-up from the perspectives of everyday people, communities, and those involved in extra-legal activities. We begin with a critical examination of the categories of “illegal,” “illicit,” “the state,” and “corruption.” We reveal these categories as socio-cultural and political constructs rather than as pre-existent neutral categories of analysis. Who applies these definitions? How have they changed and what interests do they serve? Are distinctions between “illegal” and “illicit” useful or do they obscure the power of the state to determine legitimacy? Are some activities inherently illegal? Moreover, we explore the impacts of state security and militarization efforts on extra-legal networks and experiences of insecurity.",4,Unknown

International Studies,INTS 2708 Contemporary US Foreign Policy  (4 Credits),"When the United States first won its independence, its leaders sought to avoid at all costs the countless problems awaiting any country engaging in foreign affairs. Indeed, John Quincy Adams, in 1821, warned the United States of the dangers of ""going abroad in search of monsters to destroy."" In September of 2002, however, as American forces occupied one country and prepared to invade another, the Bush Administration released its National Security Strategy of the United States, which states: ""To contend with uncertainty and to meet the many challenges we face, the United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as well as temporary access arrangements for long-distance deployment of U.S. forces."" How did we go from isolation to empire? In this course, we will attempt to answer this question by exploring the progression of American foreign policy from its emergence out of isolation to its current stage of interventionist superpower. We will also identify and discuss key issues that are driving America's conduct abroad as well as evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the given policies addressing these important issues. By the end of the class, students should have a solid knowledge of the major themes and developments in the history of American foreign policy as well as the ability to reflect critically upon on-going foreign policy debates.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2715 Introduction to Comparative Politics  (4 Credits),"This course offers an introduction to the comparative study of political systems throughout the world.  In the years following World War II, social scientists traveled extensively to newly decolonized regions of the world to examine societies there.  Many found conditions so distinct from those of the western world that they warranted new models of political development.  The distinguishing of development patterns in remote regions from those of western nations became the origin of modern comparative politics.  The course considers both the impact of internal and external variables on political development.  Internal or ""domestic"" variables include ideology, geography, economics and culture, while external variables include ""globalization"" and international conflict.  Class includes understanding and critique of models of political development including classical liberal, authoritarian, communist, post-communist, ""late"" development, and social democratic models.  It also includes discussion of possible new models in light of globalization and other factors.",4,Beginner
International Studies,INTS 2725 Comparative Politics of the Middle East  (4 Credits),"In this course we will study the political systems of the contemporary Middle East, with particular attention to dynamics of stability and change. The course introduces students to contemporary Middle Eastern politics.
The goal is to provide students with historical background and theoretical tools to answer the following core questions: (i) Why there are no Arab Democracies? (ii) What accounts for the rise and fall of popular uprisings in the Arab world since 2010? (iii) What accounts for the region’s
current economic hardships? and (vi) Would the adoption of Western‐style political institutions improve governance and stability in the region?
We will evaluate possible answers to these questions by scrutinizing the logic of theories, identifying their implications, and assessing them with available data. All of these questions will be examined in the context of the ongoing Arab uprisings.
Throughout the course, we will study three different topics; first, we will study the making of the Middle East; second, we will study a variety of dynamics shaping the current politics of the region; and finally we will tackle a number of case studies in the Middle East.

International Studies,"INTS 2760 Epidemics, Pandemics, and Panic  (4 Credits)","Sickness has terrorized humankind for centuries. Be it the Black Death, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, or the flu, diseases sweep through society leaving death and destruction in their wake. At times, it is the the microbes that cause the greatest amount of suffering. Smallpox, for example, is believed to have killed 200-300 million people in the 20th century alone. But at other times, it is the people, who respond with ignorance and fear, that exacerbated the situation and inflict untold pain. Public policies which punished the poor for their poverty resulted in a million plus deaths during the Irish Potato Famine is one such example. Likewise, community responses couched in fear and victim blaming left tens of thousands to die from HIV/AIDS before serious public efforts to attack the disease began.
Although illness brings out the worst in humanity, it also brings out its best. It was the pain and suffering from smallpox that led to the creation of the vaccine, a tool that saved millions of lives. It was belief in the benefits of a smallpox-free world that led mortal enemies to work together during the Cold War to eradicate this threat.
This course will examine threats to the health of people around the world, it will look at the scientific tools available to protect our health, and will explore how both biological and social factors contribute to successes and failures of such efforts. This course is designed for those who do not have any background in public health, biology, or in public policy but are fascinated by how global society shapes and is shaped by the most humble or living things—microscopic organisms. Throughout the class, you will learn the basics about biological factors that influence the spread of disease, and learn about medical and social tools we have to control the same. We will examine public and policy response to ancient and modern plagues. Case studies include Black Death, Smallpox, influenza, HIV/AIDS, famine, and emerging biological threats.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2780 Global Corporate Responsibility and Accountability  (4 Credits),"The course explores the role of corporate responsibility and accountability in a global context. Neoliberal globalization characterized by free trade has greatly expanded the role of global corporations in most countries. The practices and behavior of corporations are determining the quality of life for people throughout the globe. Yet there are few rules and laws that govern corporations on a global scale. While a corporation may exhibit social and environmental responsibility and respect human rights in one country, it may be a different matter altogether in the Global South where there are fewer restrictions on corporate behavior.
Transnational corporations increasingly recognize that engaging in good practices to improve lives and communities extends beyond ethical and moral considerations. In many cases, corporations have been forced to change practices due to actions by civil society and governments. These actions have meant that corporations must consider monetary and reputational risks when considering the effects of their operations. These risks are increasingly built into business models to reduce expected and unexpected costs of community resistance and civil unrest. This has resulted in the “business case for global corporate responsibility.” Against this backdrop are charges by NGOs and labor unions of corporations engaging in “greenwashing” and “blue-washing.”
The course seeks to expose students to various forms of corporate responsibility and accountability together with several global governance systems. The course will be useful to those students who are concerned about the ethics of global corporate investment and may want to work inside a transnational company. The course will also appeal to those who want to affect change through government or civil society organizations. It will also be advantageous to those interested in pursuing further study in this area. Finally, third party social auditing of transnational corporations is expanding, and the course provides some insights on work in this area.",4,Unknown

At the end of this course, 1) students will have listened to the voices of indigenous, Black, and Latin women describing the oppression their communities have faced, 2) thought deeply about the “solidarity-dividend” (Heather McGhee) available to all including white folks in college education, health care, and every aspect of economic and social wellbeing, 3) have an understanding the role of settler colonialism and colonialism in the initial emergence and reemergence of fascism, and 4) understood the characteristic features, from Nazism to Putin to today in America, of the anti-democratic and inhuman Right.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 2810 Racism and Resistance: Denver and Beyond  (4 Credits),"Our country and our University have achieved some great things. But our history is also one of genocidal racist misogynies, starting at DU and in Denver with the Sand Creek Massacre and the later rule of the KKK and ""eugenics."" Listening to the voices and responding to the actions of those whose humanity has long been denied is a first step to creating a genuine democracy which upholds the equal basic rights of each person (what is foreshadowed - though only for some - in the First Amendment). Growing out of discoveries about this history in the University Report on John Evans and the Sand Creek Massacre as well as a new manuscript, ""Murderous Bigotries,"" which relies on extensive research in the DU and Denver Public Library Archives, this course will honor first and foremost the voices of those long denied or forgotten who worked, mainly from below, to challenge these oppressions. It will also identify the destructive consequences for all of us of ""'white' supremacist"" misogyny.",4,Unknown

In the first two introductory classes, you acquired knowledge about international politics and the global economy. In this class, we investigate where that knowledge came from. How do researchers learn things about the political world?   And how can you do this kind of research yourself? Students will learn about different types of international studies research, and will practice collecting and evaluating evidence from interviews, surveys, the written record, and quantitative sources. You will learn to ask a compelling research question, critically evaluate existing research on your subject, and find evidence that will help you answer your question.

International Studies,INTS 3000 Research Methods & Design  (4 Credits),"This course is designed for advanced International Studies majors, including Department Distinction, that intend to write a thesis in INTS. It introduces students to the fundamental elements of social science research and will serve as a workshop to complete a literature review and write a research proposal.  The basis of any scientific investigation is the research proposal in which you formulate a question and design a process by which you will explore that question through a systematic collection and analysis of evidence. The design process is the same whether you are writing a short class research paper, or are conducting a major research project, such as a thesis. The manner in which evidence is gathered and analyzed, however, will vary based upon the research question, research goals, and resources. We will therefore go through the process of research design. Because international studies provides multiple methods of inquiry, we will also explore quantitative and qualitative methods that may be used to gather and analyze evidence.

International Studies,INTS 3009 Culture and Politics in Japan  (4 Credits),"The main aim of this course is to understand how the political culture of Japan has impacted both its domestic and foreign policy. The course analyses the Japanese political culture within its historical context, highlighting the question of how the culture of Japan interacted with other dynamics (such as history, economy, social and political forces) to shape modern Japanese politics both at home and abroad. Social and political actors such as conservative political parties, the bureaucracy, and the business community are closely analyzed. Special attention is given to study how Japan was caught between different geostrategic-cultural orientations such as ""Westernism"" and ""Asianism"" and the impact of these factors on Japan's postwar foreign relations. In this context, the course is looking to see how the defeat in WWII has impacted both the political culture and foreign policy in Japan.
Through this summer visit to Japan (Tokyo and Hiroshima), students will meet scholars of Japanese political science and public administration, diplomats, members of political parties, NGOs, and the business community. Moreover, visits to historical sites, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum (Hiroshima), the Diet (the Japanese parliament), and both modern and historical cities in greater Tokyo area are also planned to get primary data for better understanding Japanese politics and culture.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3013 Corruption – A Global Epidemic  (4 Credits),"Corruption is a ubiquitous phenomenon in all political systems, whether democratic or authoritarian - from illegal campaign contributions and lobbying tactics in America, to vote buying and hijacking elections in Africa, from rigging official government-issued macroeconomic reports in Europe, to securing safe havens for drug, arms, and human trafficking in Latin America and Asia. This class explores corruption from a comparative and international perspective and raises questions such as: What is corruption and how is it measured? What are its causes and effects? Do they vary across countries or regions in the world? When and how does it impede economic opportunity and can it actually lead to efficiency gains? Through what mechanisms does it erode political legitimacy and democratic institutions? What are the “human” costs of corruption? In asking these questions, the course features a number of documentaries and tries to evaluate how conditions for and outcomes of corrupt behavior are similar and different across Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In addition to the issues related to corruption, the class will also offer a critical review of the contemporary recommendations for “fixing” the problem.

International Studies,INTS 3016 Global Governance  (4 Credits),"The term “global governance” is often associated with the deepening of globalization. Many parts of what we see as global governance, though, from international law to international organizations to international regimes to international norms have longer histories. The architecture of global governance has often been assumed to be nation states organized into international organizations but in the last 30 years we have witnessed an increasing range of different actors and forms. In this course, we will examine these various actors and forms and how they interact in the governance of three issues areas: climate change, business/security/human rights, and cyber.

International Studies,"INTS 3017 The Revolutions of Black, Brown, and Indigenous Peoples: Violence and Nonviolence  (4 Credits)","This course focuses on revolutions of black, brown and indigenous people in the Americas, ones historically forgotten in academia, as well as the issue of violence and nonviolence in the Chinese, Indian, Tibetan and South African revolutionary movements.  It will set this glaring omission and rich discussion in the context of the eugenics which marked the study of international relations and sociology, including of revolutions, in the United States in the 1920 and 1930s and whose influence continues until now.  We will begin from Robert Vitalis’s surprising White World Order, Black Power which underlines the central role of W.E.B. Dubois in challenging these racist disciplines.  We will also read Aldon Morris’s The Scholar Denied on Dubois’ founding of an anti-racist American sociology and how, for political reasons, this came to be denied by the famous, egregiously racist “Chicago” school of Robert Park.    We will begin from the great struggles – black soldiers on both sides in the American Revolution and how black Patriots played the decisive role on the American side, benefiting all revolutionaries (Gilbert, Black Patriots and Loyalists), the great  insurrection of people who were enslaved which made Haiti (CLR James, Black Jacobins and Elizabeth Fick, The Making of Haiti),  and the role of pardos (blacks) and indigenous people in Venezuela (Robin Blackburn, The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery) – in the New World.  We will trace the role of those who were enslaved  in forging many great revolutions – each of which is vital to creating a free society for all - which have been hidden academically and historically, by a kind of amnesia.  We will then explore the debates about  violence and nonviolence central in mass uprisings against colonial racism and domination in China, Tibet, India, and South Africa.  We will consider explanations of why such major revolutionary movements have been long “forgotten” in academic study and ask what new light these revolutions cast on the standard trajectory of European revolutions.  At the end of the 19th century, W.E.B. Dubois, for example, refers to the “color line” in projecting  twentieth century movements.  In academia, the past is often interpreted in a “too European” and, unselfconsciously, “White” (often “forgetting” colonialist and racist crimes…; hostile to ordinary white folks) idiom.    In addition, we will discuss the revolution from below in China - rarely considered with dispassion or even sympathetically, though Theda Skocpol and William Hinton do - as well as the oppression/ethnic cleansing of minorities in China, particularly in Tibet. We will thus contrast some strengths and weaknesses of regimes emerging from violent revolutions in the Americas, Haiti, and China, and look at attempts to forge mass nonviolent revolutions and learn from/modify Gandhi in India, Tibet and South Africa.  We will also compare movements of indigenous people in the Americas, Palestinians, and Tibetans against settler colonialism.  Finally, we will ask to what extent the nonviolent transition to a new regime actually limits future oppression and violence in India and South Africa. Prerequisites:INTS 1500andINTS 1700.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3020 Introduction to Middle East and Islamic Politics  (4 Credits),"The contemporary politics of the Middle East cannot be understood without some debate of the West's relationship with the region and the associated view of the Orient that grew out of this relationship.  In light of this reality, the state system that has emerged in the region since the demise of colonialism forms a suitable framework in which to understand the major themes of this course.  The first major theme to be discussed is the impact of colonialism on the region, particularly in the latter half of the nineteenth century and first half of the twentieth century.  In this section of the course we explore the nature of political rule and government and the prevailing economic motive behind this imperial and colonial relationship.  The second theme of this course explores political ideologies, both secular and religious.  A historical overview of this development will be explored in the context of current theories of nationalism posited by authors such as Benedict Anderson, Eric Hobsbawm and Ernest Gellner.  The final section of this course briefly explores the theme of democratization and its discontents in the Middle East.  The focus is on recent debates about democratization that have been promoted from outside the region as a means of combating tyranny within the region, particularly the perceived anti-democratic nature of political Islam.

International Studies,INTS 3021 Introduction to Islam and Politics  (4 Credits),"Since the eruption of the 'Islamic Revolution' in Iran in 1979, ‘political Islam’ has influenced both public and academic debates. Though often accused of being ‘anti-democratic’ forces, Islamic political actors have dominated electoral politics in the Middle East and have spread politically elsewhere in world politics. The Islamic Salvation Front “ISF” in Algeria, the Justice and Development Party “AKP” in Turkey, the Islamist Hamas in Palestine, Nahda in Tunisia, and Muslim Brothers in Egypt have all defeated their secular opponents in democratic elections in the last three decades and many of them were ousted by military interventions. What is political Islam about? Is it harmonious with democracy? What are its intellectual, social, and historical roots? How do Islamists behave when in power and opposition and why? These are some of the pivotal questions to be addressed in this course. Prerequisites:INTS 1500andINTS 1700.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3025 Current Issues in Human Security  (4 Credits),"This course surveys the various debates, concepts, and issues clustered around human security.  Human security is a relatively new concept that challenges the traditional, state-centric approach of ""national"" security.  A more inclusive term, human security includes economic, environmental, and social concerns such as poverty, climate change, crime, and disease in addition to the traditional focus on conflict and political violence.  This course will explore the development of human security as a term, focusing particularly on the emergence of human security as a category of global governance.  It will also investigate a range of issues that challenge human security.  Students will engage with these issues through assigned readings, class discussion, policy assessment, and in-depth case studies.  Prerequisites:INTS 1500andINTS 1700.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3030 Sports and International Politics  (4 Credits),"This advanced undergraduate course in international studies explores the complex connections between sports and international politics in the past and present and sport’s relationships to international peace, both historically and in contemporary times.  At the heart of this contribution is the need to examine sport as an international issue, to explore and its relationship to the protection and advancement of human rights (to include gender equality and the rights of those with disabilities), and to critically examine the role of sport in fostering community-level social cohesion and inclusive national unity.  Participants in the course will gain a critical knowledge of the origins, background, and issues in global sport, especially the Olympic Games, and a critical awareness of the potential opportunities and obstacles for sport in social development.  Learning outcomes are attained through faculty presentations, guided discussions, and student-led research. The course is designed as a research colloquium in which participants develop and share a research dossier on course topics with a capstone seminar to integrate learning and share findings on historical and contemporary issues at the intersection of sport, power, profit, and peace.",4,Advanced
International Studies,INTS 3040 Technology and Development  (4 Credits),"From the classic works of Adam Smith and Karl Marx to contemporary analyses by noted development economists Jeffrey Sachs and William Easterly, the role of technology in fostering economic growth and wider well being is firmly established. As the application of embodied knowledge, technology enables increased productivity, as well as new capabilities, goods, and services. While the role of technology in promoting human advancement is well established, the specific processes required for the effective development and use of technologies is less understood. Further, technological development varies considerably between developed and developing contexts with persistent inequalities hindering basic needs for billions.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3070 Political Economy of Latin America  (4 Credits),"The study of development in Latin America, exceptionally rich in natural resources, offers an opportunity to explore the interplay between the forces of economic development and efforts to achieve greater equity, representation, and ecological balance.  We open with a consideration of different perspectives on development. Should the purpose be to increase wealth, reduce poverty, become more “modern”? How much attention should be given to protecting the environment? We follow with a discussion of the external influences in Latin American development including the role of the U.S., investors, banks, and other major powers. Along the way, we will give special attention to the increasing emphasis on the extractive industries and their impacts, including economic growth, urbanization, and the rise of some of the largest fortunes in the world, along with adverse effects on the environment, human health, and the prospects for the survival of many indigenous and rural communities.  Finally, we will be looking at social movements and other strategies, which address these adverse conditions. In many cases, individual communities, specific sectors, and broad segments of civil society are resisting the harms of neoliberal policy and advancing alternatives that stress greater equality, democratic participation, and ecological balance. These struggles are some of the most exciting events in political economy.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3085 Global Economic Challenges  (4 Credits),"This course deals with the major challenges facing policymakers in the global economy today. We discuss how policymakers balance competing objectives of pursuing economic progress, ensuring national and international security, and advancing global equity and sustainability. We focus on global institutions as well as informal mechanisms for cooperation between world leaders and key national decision-makers. Topics covered include globalization and economic interdependence, the provision of global public goods, achieving sustainable development, tackling inequality, responding to economic crises, pursuing productivity growth, dealing with international migration, and promoting democracy.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3111 Migration and Development  (4 Credits),"This course will discuss the multifaceted relationships between human migration and development. We will explore both the ways that development influences migration and the ways that migration, in turn, shapes development. While the course will be global in scope, we will pay particular attention to the way that these global processes impact communities locally, applying our classroom learning to economic and social development challenges faced by immigrants and refugees in the Denver area.   The course will focus on how human mobility (and immobility) affects prospects for economic and social development on three levels: the development of (a) the communities and countries people leave, (b) migrants themselves, and (c) the communities and countries that people enter. We will also consider modern barriers to mobility and the economic and ethical implications of modern migration management regimes. Students will be actively involved in their learning through group projects, debates, and reflective writing. Prerequisites:INTS 1500andINTS 1700.",4,Unknown

International Studies,INTS 3205 Comparative Politics of the Middle East  (4 Credits),"In this course, we will study the political systems of the contemporary Middle East, with particular attention to dynamics of stability and change. The course introduces students to contemporary Middle Eastern politics. The goal is to provide students with historical background and theoretical tools to answer the following core questions: (i) why there are no Arab Democracies? (ii) What accounts for the rise and fall of popular uprisings in the Arab world since 2010? (iii) What accounts for the region’s current economic hardships? (vi) Would the adoption of Western‐style political institutions improve governance and stability in the region? We will evaluate possible answers to these questions by scrutinizing the logic of theories, identifying their implications, and assessing them with available data. All of these questions will be examined in the context of the ongoing Arab uprisings.",4,Beginner
International Studies,INTS 3210 Political Violence and its End  (4 Credits),"This course centers on the nature, character, strategies and termination of the range of forms political violence -- violence used to achieve political ends be it by states, the international community, or non-state actors -- takes in the early 21st century. After a general discussion of the lexicon of security, force, war, and war termination, each of the five forms of political violence are explored beginning with a discussion of the fundamentals, an exploration of the current context and character of the form centering on a leading book on the subject, and then a discussion of counter-strategies and broader political/societal considerations. The course ends with a similar three part discussion of the political/military realities and necessities of violence termination. Prerequisites:INTS 1500andINTS 1700.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3212 Civilian Protection in Armed Conflicts  (4 Credits),"There are many courses on security topics. Civil wars, terrorism, violence, genocide,
peacekeeping and peacebuilding, humanitarian intervention, human security…the list
goes on. This course is different. This course is about the protection of civilians in
wartime. Civilian protection is one of the great challenges of our time. The means of
violence have been distributed and small groups of people are able inflict harm as never
before in human history. Yet there are also emerging and cutting-edge procedures and
technologies available to the “protectors.” Civilian protection is a new perspective on
security that differs from existing treatments of this topic.
We will begin the course with an overview of theories of violence and legal and ethical
frameworks governing the use of force. We will consider issues such as what it means to
be a civilian, and what normative and strategic considerations motivate decision-makers
to take protective actions. The rest of the course is organized by the different actors that
might provide protection. We will consider (theoretically and empirically) how various
actors throughout society, from state actors, to international organizations, to illegal
armed actors, to NGOs, to civilians and their communities—the would-be victims of
violence—can either promote or restrain the use of violence. We will also consider the
conditions under which the protection of civilians is most feasible as well as research
methods for analyzing populations and their protection strategies. In their final projects,
students will analyze the threats of violence faced by a particular population and design
appropriate protection strategies and policies to deal with them. Prerequisites:INTS 1500andINTS 1700.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3214 International Peace & Security  (4 Credits),"At a moment of deep domestic division over the nature of challenges to peace and security, either at home or abroad, crucial actors in defining and meeting those challenges will be ordinary citizens, whose personal views are reflected in forms including voting, political action, and—as we tragically saw on January 6, 2021—the use of force. In an increasingly autocratic world, citizens of the U.S. and other struggling democracies are now crucial actors on the world stage. While this course will include traditional “state centric” approaches to international peace and security, it seeks to enable students to reach personal conclusions regarding what is worth fighting for and against, informed by one’s values and judgments over what is politically realistic to pursue, domestically and internationally.

International Studies,INTS 3215 Major Issues in International Security  (4 Credits),"This course begins (in Part I) by considering the threat that created the field of “security studies” following the second World War: the origins and evolution of the nuclear danger. Part I ends with an assessment of the most dangerous manifestation of that threat in several decades: North Korea’s acquisition of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.  We turn next to addressing (in Part II) a question that seemed answered since the dawn of the nuclear age, when the United States moved from its defeat of Fascism in World War II to the containment of communism in the Cold War, to expanding the zone of free market democracies during the post-Cold War era: What does the United States seek to secure?   Even if all could agree on the nature of particular security threats and the fundamental goals of security policy (as occurred for the United States after the attack on Pearl Harbor), enormous challenges confront the formation and implementation of national security strategy and policy. Part III of the course will identify and evaluate those challenges, using the 2003 decision to invade Iraq as a case study of the enduring problems that confront national security policy-making. We finally turn (in Part IV) to analyzing a series of current issues, including the threat posed by violent Islamist organizations, the consequences of U.S. disengagement in the Middle East, the impact of changing technology on the international security environment, (drones, surveillance, cyberwar, hybrid warfare), and the risk of conflict between the United States and two other major powers: Russia, and China.

International Studies,INTS 3220 Trafficking in Persons/Smuggling of Migrants  (4 Credits),"Through the Education for Justice (E4J) initiative, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has developed a series of university modules with a focus on the subject areas of crime prevention and criminal justice, anti-corruption, organized crime, trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants, firearms, cybercrime, wildlife, forest and fisheries crime, counter-terrorism as well as integrity and ethics.  In recent years there have been few topics garnering as much widespread interest as trafficking in persons (TIP) and smuggling of migrants (SOM). These issues have attracted the attention of Governments, NGOs, International Organizations, the media as well as academia. While this attention tends to provoke vivid discussions in political circles, social networks and other media platforms, there is little solid understanding of TIP and SOM, the difference between them and their implications.  Last Spring, I joined 12 other academics with expertise in human trafficking and human smuggling from around the work for a week in Doha, Qatar to create a syllabus primarily for the teaching of TIP and SOM at universities and colleges. The 14 Modules on TIP and SOM will provide students with a practically oriented, though still theoretically grounded, tool to understand these issues. Thanks to the inputs received from an addition 100+ academics from all around the world, the Modules' contents are substantively robust. This strength is reinforced with a series of illustrative examples and exercises aimed at generating debates and consolidating knowledge among students. Given the considerable safety risks posed by TIP and SOM and the related need to ensure that perpetrators are made accountable, the course relies heavily on a legal approach, acknowledging the importance of clarifying concepts and employing rigorous terminology. This notwithstanding, the course is also grounded in a multidisciplinary methodology, recognizing that the complexity of the trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling phenomena extends beyond the legal realm. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of TIP and SOM is not possible without the convergence of various disciplines, expertise and perspectives, including the historical, economic, social, political, and gender prisms, that are all considered in developing the course.

International Studies,INTS 3225 Terrorism  (4 Credits),"Over the last century, the term terrorism has been applied most often to the illegal use of violence aimed at governments—directly or indirectly—in an attempt to influence policy or to topple an existing regime. Terrorist acts are designed to create widespread fear across an audience far beyond their immediate victims in order to weaken the general sense of security in society, and to mobilize publics and pressure leaders to change. Historically, terrorism has been practiced by political organizations on the right and on the left, used by nationalist and religious groups, by revolutionaries, and by state institutions including military forces and intelligence services. Numerous definitions of terrorism have been proposed. Many are confusing and controversial owing to the value-laden basis of the concept and its intense stigma. Who seeks to be called a ‘terrorist’? This derogatory term is designated by its victims and ideological opponents. But it is not applied to all episodes of politically-based violence.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3347 China in the Global Economy  (4 Credits),"It is impossible to discern the 21st century without having some level of understanding of China, which now possesses the largest army in the world, the biggest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, and the greatest number of people. Chinese firms provide foreign direct investment (FDI) worth $3.8 trillion in stocks by 2018 and Chinese policy banks fund official financing totaling around $648 billion between 2000 and 2018. Chinese technology firms have launched some of the most widely used applications such as TikTok and Zoom. The Ministry of Finance, the People’s Bank of China, and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council have been able to rewrite some of the global development architecture, launching the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative. Global trade passes through Chinese land or maritime economic zones, comprising 12.4% of global trade in 2019. In security issues, the Chinese Ministries and the People’s Liberation Army have been at the forefront of redefining norms, such as the responsibility to protect, global intervention, and the universal declaration of human rights. In climate change, Chinese electric vehicle companies have been at the front and center of these new carbon-free technologies, and renewable energy firms have made strides at limiting carbon emissions within the Chinese borders.

International Studies,INTS 3372 Comparative Genocide  (4 Credits),"Violence is, and will continue to be, a central feature of our social world. Despite repeated choruses of “never again,” genocides and campaigns of widespread atrocities have occurred with alarming frequency since the Nazi Holocaust during World War II. This course introduces you to this depressing – but important – topic by examining the historical origins, patterns, and legacies of contemporary genocides around the world. We begin with the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1948, which legally codified the definition of genocide and compelled ratifying parties to prevent its reoccurrence.
We will discuss the definitional and analytical challenges facing this subject, as well as academic and policy debates regarding how to define and prevent genocide. We will also focus on how individuals and communities have resisted such atrocities through solidarity, art, non-violent action, and other creative strategies to reclaim their humanity together. We will also talk about how and when institutions, civil society, and a free press can serve as important bulwarks against such violence. And we will pay particular attention to how mass atrocities end and how they might be prevented. Prerequisite:INTS 1500&INTS 1700.",4,Beginner

International Studies,INTS 3420 Climate Security  (4 Credits),"Since the dawn of agriculture (~7000 BCE), but rapidly accelerating in the industrial age (1750 CE to the present), humanity has conducted an uncontrolled experiment in bending the natural environment to fit human needs and desires. Despite the perceived distance that technology has placed between our physical environments and our daily lives, human interactions with our natural environment are still fundamental – and set to be disrupted by climate change, one of the most vexing issues of our time. It poses a wicked problem: a socio/cultural problem that is seemingly impossible to solve due to incomplete knowledge, the number of people and opinions involved, the large changes required, and the linked nature of the problem with other major social issues and problems.   Since the end of the Cold War, much attention has been paid to the role of natural resources and environmental scarcity as a source of conflict, ranging from “water wars” between states sharing a common river basin to communal conflict between pastoralists and farmers in the Sahel and even the Syrian Civil War. This course will survey the impacts of climate change on livelihoods and human security, evaluate the expanding literature on environmental impacts on conflict, and address the emerging role of environmental stressors and climate change as US national security issues.

International Studies,INTS 3421 Environmental Justice Policy and Practice  (4 Credits),"Environmental justice (EJ) asks how we can ensure a fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the design, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. In short, how can we facilitate an environment where people live, work, and play exempt from unequitable allocations of environmental benefits (such as natural resource distributions) and harms (such as environmental health hazards).
The course will present a historical overview of the EJ movement in the United States and its intersections with global EJ. It will cover the theoretical and practical methods used in environmental policy to assist government agencies, from the local to the global, in addressing immediate and long-term environmental justice challenges. Particular attention will be placed on the Colorado State legislature and how different environmental justice bills are designed and negotiated through the legislative session. Students will examine proposed bills and their relationships to social theories on EJ, diverse actors’ interests and needs, and the appropriateness of the solutions presented to address specific environmental inequities. This will require group collaboration to examine specific EJ bills and produce in-class presentations and a policy brief that engages students critically with the course material and a real-world EJ issue.
In short, with this course you will:
• Learn about the EJ movement history
• Create and share your own EJ story
• Explore issues in water access & air quality, food insecurity, access to nature and open spaces, and more
• Understand EJ policy in Colorado and beyond
• Analyze EJ policies in the Colorado State legislature

International Studies,INTS 3425 Political Psychology  (4 Credits),"Political psychology provides an important lens for studying and understanding political phenomena and global patterns. It maintains that the study of individuals and groups is essential for understanding political behavior, and such study must go beyond rational actor assumptions to an understanding of how individuals and groups behave in political contexts and what influences this behavior. Political decisions and actions are ultimately taken by individual actors, whether they be leaders, elites, or average citizens. This course will explore this important area of theory and research lying at the intersection of several fields – psychology and political science of course, but also sociology, anthropology, organizational studies, and even neuroscience. Why do we see a rise in populism across many countries? How do atrocities and genocides occur? Why is developing peaceful and multicultural societies so difficult? How is voter choice influenced? Why do leaders do what they do? What does security actually mean to people? How is reconciliation achieved? The course will use a combination of readings, case studies, and discussions to enhance class members’ understanding and appreciation of the central concepts, theories, research methods, and applications of political psychology.",4,Unknown

International Studies,INTS 3435 Political Economy of Globalization  (4 Credits),"This course aims to provide an in-depth understanding of globalization and its differential impact on advanced and developing countries, using a wide range of literature from political science and political economy. The term ‘globalization’ connotes many different developments and processes and has become a leitmotiv of contemporary debate. It is an ‘essentially contested’ concept, which means that there are multiple meanings attached to it and that it has been heavily invested with normative claims. It can be used to capture the increasing speed and volume of communications, the spread of mass media, the growth of the internet, and the expansion in cross-border and transnational flows of goods, services, jobs, and capital. All of these things are important.
But precisely because of the range of phenomena it is used to refer to, and because of its frequent deployment for ideological ends, the notion of globalization must be handled with care. Though it conveys a reality that needs to be understood, it is often used lazily by the media, as a means of avoiding blame by politicians and for personal aggrandizement by certain public intellectuals. All play on the fear of what lies beyond our control. As employed in this course,
‘globalization’ lies primarily in the domain of economics—and in the social and political implications of economic change. Globalization in this sense can be reduced to:
• trade (the movement of goods and services across national borders);
• direct investment (the purchase of factories or equipment abroad);
• and capital flows (the movement of money across national borders).",4,Advanced
International Studies,"INTS 3455 Modeling for Policy: Development, Sustainability, and Conflict  (4 Credits)","This course is intended to provide students with an introduction to the current state of affairs in macro-level human development across issue areas. It will provide them with tools to better understand how to think about these complicated and potentially intractable challenges. This course introduces students to analysis using one class of quantitative tools called integrated assessment models (IAMs), which quantitatively represent complex systems in interaction. IAMs are tools that formally model the interaction across key development systems, like demographics, economics, energy, and the environment. They can be used to 1) think critically about how key trends are unfolding, 2) identify leverage points; and 3) explore the impact of changing policies and environmental uncertainties on desired outcomes.",4,Beginner
International Studies,INTS 3485 The Role of Religion in International Affairs  (4 Credits),"The role of religion in international affairs was largely unexplored by scholars prior to September 11, 2001 when religiously based acts of terrorism shook the world. Since that time there has been an increased interest in examining religion in terms of its’ impact on the international system. Is religion a force for good or evil within the international system? How influential is religion in international politics? Does religion matter or is it merely background noise in our study of the international system? In short, this course examines the role of religion in international affairs with an eye toward understanding political violence, political economy and conflict resolution in terms of religion and religious actors.

International Studies,INTS 3505 International Health and Development  (4 Credits),"Investment in health and investment in development work symbiotically in the production of economic and human well-being. However, what constitutes health and development varies across context, institutions, and geographies. This course will focus on the meaning, measurement, financing and delivery of inputs to human well-being and other aspects of development. This course will explore dominant models of health and development, what assumptions inform these models, and who is left unaccounted for within each. We will examine how macro-level decisions, decisions made by global or national institutions, impact both options and outcomes at the community and individual level. The exchange between development policies and health interventions will be explored. We will examine and critique the instruments and methods that are used to measure health and development and the assumptions that inform mainstream development and health paradigms.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3530 Feeding the World: Global Food Security and Food System Sustainability  (4 Credits),"This course asks students to critically explore contemporary debates about the global food and farming system with an eye to understanding its structure, operation, ideological basis, and impacts on people around the world. Of special interest in the course is the manner in which the global food and farming system both creates and aggravates global inequalities. Students focus partly on theories of and ideas about the role of agriculture in the economy, society and the development process, the appropriate structure and orientation of agricultural production and distribution, the role of the state in directing food production and distribution, and the nature of justice for farmers and eaters. Students further engage a spectrum policy debates and case studies that particularly illustrate the workings of the global food and farming system and the harsh contradictions that underpin it. Among other topics, students are exposed to debates about food prices, hunger and famine, obesity, commercial production and agribusiness, the peasantry and subsistence farming, biotechnology, free agricultural trade, fair trade, agricultural pollution and agriculturally-induced climate change.

International Studies,INTS 3560 Globalization and International Security  (4 Credits),"Globalization moved a long time ago from social science to omnipresent buzz word, but with increased usage has not always come increased understanding. Globalization is the increased participation, and consciousness of that participation, by individuals in global, that is to say trans-regional or transnational, networks. Today's globalization is made possible in large part by dramatic and continuing changes in technology, but its impacts are social, economic, political, and potentially military changes in perception, in scale, in magnitude, and in threat. This course specifically concentrates at the intersection of global networks, the technology that makes them possible today and tomorrow, and current political and military security challenges to include national and internal state security, global terrorism, global insurgency, and cyber warfare.

International Studies,INTS 3590 Politics in Africa: A Theoretical Approach with a Comparative Perspective  (4 Credits),"This course introduces students to basic concepts and arguments in the study of contemporary African politics. The focus is on the politics in Africa post-independence. The course emphasizes theory in a comparative perspective as a way to understand politics in Africa. The basic question is whether politics differ so much in Africa as to be in a category by itself or is it simply a variation on patterns, habits, and institutions found in other regions and countries in the world? The course goal is to provide students with important concepts so as to gain a better understanding of processes in Africa and the problems that in some fashion or other account for the continent's current marginality in the world and persistent underdevelopment. In addition, the course exposes students to the application and usefulness of general theories of development in comparative politics. Prerequisites:INTS 1500andINTS 1700.",4,Beginner
International Studies,INTS 3591 Contemporary African Security  (4 Credits),"The end of apartheid in 1993 signaled a critical juncture for African liberation and security. The fall of South Africa’s repressive regime marked a new era in African statehood and security apparatus. Apartheid posed the most threat to sovereignty especially for Southern Africa countries and undermined independence on the continent. With the new African National Congress government led by the Nelson Mandala, African countries were poised to focus on development and regional integration to cement cooperation, economic growth and improve the wellbeing of the African people. However, the new epoch coincided with novel challenges to statehood and security as the continent was quickly ravaged by civil wars. Today the continent continues to face numerous security challenges that are interwoven in contemporary global problems like climate change and the rise non-states actors. Using an interdisciplinary approach, this course assesses contemporary security challenges in Africa such as terrorism, insurgency and piracy by examining the causes and institutional frameworks put in place to address them.

International Studies,INTS 3621 European Democracy in Crisis  (4 Credits),"This course is a comparative study of democratic governments in Western Europe, how these systems are structured and function, and more particularly the new challenges and problems that are emerging in the region: Euroscepticism, populism, support for right-wing parties, and political polarization. Democracy is the institutionalization of conflict, but democratic regimes vary in regard to the ways that they structure the arenas within which conflict is expressed.  We will explore some of those institutional distinctions that vary across Western Europe such as Presidential vs. parliamentary systems, fragmented multi-party systems vs. majoritarian two-party systems, as well as the nature of political parties and the dynamics of party systems. The study of Western European democratic polities however requires some retrospective historical analysis of the nature of the conflicts emerging since the creation of the Modern State and the establishment of democracy. Because many of the present conflicts and problems in today's democratic regimes are legacies with roots in conflicts from the emergence of contemporary states, we will also spend some time in analyzing some of these historical conflicts.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3625 Introduction to Contemporary Latin American Politics  (4 Credits),"This course provides an introduction to the study of Latin American politics. It is designed to provide students the opportunity to better understand how Latin American societies and political systems are organized and the major issues facing these governments and their citizens. In particular, this course will explore the establishment of democracy and the prospects for the consolidation of democratic regimes in the countries of the region.
Throughout the twentieth century, economic, social and international factors contributed to political instability in the region and the establishment of non-democratic forms of rule. Although a wave of democratic transitions in the 1980s and 1990s transformed most Latin American countries into electoral democracies, the extent to which countries can be said to have fully democratic regimes varies widely today.

International Studies,INTS 3630 Global Environment  (4 Credits),"The linkages between social change, economic change and alterations to ecosystems have been apparent, if not overtly acknowledged, throughout history. It was not until 1987, however, with the publication of Our Common Future, that such linkages were couched in terms of development and explicitly placed on the international development agenda. The idea appears simple--environmental change, patterns of social change and economic development, social and political factors operate together and impact local, national, regional and global ecosystems. But impacts of the change in any one sector are seldom confined within national boundaries. How then does one address environmental issues across different regulatory, political, institutional and geographic scales? This course examines the connectivity between diverse elements of our planet's ecosystem, explores how a change in one element can have immediate and long-term impacts across local and global territory, and looks at strategies to create greater harmony across environmental, social, political and economic interests. Prerequisites:INTS 1500andINTS 1700.",4,Unknown
International Studies,INTS 3660 States in Transition and European Integration  (4 Credits),"This course examines states in transition in Europe and on its periphery. The central question the course asks is why, looking across the post-communist world, many states have joined the European Union and also the North Atlantic Treaty Organizations, while many others have held on to authoritarian means or rule or have been party to armed conflict. While Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Baltic States have acclimated themselves to many European Union rules relatively smoothly, Hungary has become the least democratic state in the Union. At the same time, Georgia, Ukraine and Russia are embroiled in protracted and in some ways interrelated conflicts, with democratic consolidation either seriously compromised or not even on the agenda. This course examines these diverging trends, drawing on a range of international relations and comparative politics approaches to explain highly variable outcomes across the region.

International Studies,INTS 3715 The Politics and Policy of Sustainable Energy  (4 Credits),"Energy is much in the news, with highly visible controversies over everything from hydraulic fracturing here in Colorado to oil pipelines to mountaintop removal for coal mining to raptor mortality at wind farms. These controversies range from local city ordinances to global treaties and involve everyone from environmental groups to governments to businesses of all sizes. It can be difficult to make sense of this cacophony of events. Where is the global energy system now, where is it going, and what will impede progress toward an energy system that will both serve human needs and protect the environment? Understanding these questions requires background knowledge that puts them into context and creates the opportunity to understand them more deeply.
This course will introduce you to the politics and policies involved in sustainable energy, from the local to the global level. In order to make sense of those policies and politics, it will also introduce students to the basics of the energy system, including both conventional and alternative sources.",4,Beginner

International Studies,INTS 3780 The Ethical Foundations of the Global Economy  (4 Credits),"This course explores the ethics that underlie the most pressing debates today in global economic policymaking. Most people know that economists typically endorse the policy of ""free trade,"" or the outcome of ""economic growth."" Indeed, economists advocate these so often that it seems self-evident that these are obviously desirable. But why is this so? What is the ethical grounding for the economist's stance on these matters? Unfortunately, economists themselves don't often explore the ethical foundations that underlie their policy perspectives. They typically write as if these foundations are obviously correct and beyond doubt. But in fact, the ethical foundations of economics are hotly contested--both within economics and in philosophy and other disciplines. This course is intended to help students make ethical sense of contemporary global economic policy debates. To that end, we move back and forth between abstract theoretical debates (in economics and philosophy) and concrete, applied policy matters. For instance, we examine the current debate over ""free trade"" versus ""fair trade."" We see why most advocates for labor, women's and human rights and most environmentalists demand fair trade, and why most neoclassical economists reject these claims and instead advocate free trade.

language like Japanese, which shares no linguistic roots with European languages, questions
of translation are magnified and problematized by linguistic difference, histories of
Orientalism and colonization, and fundamentally different literary aesthetics, especially in
literatures of premodern Japan and early modern Europe. Questions this course considers
include: with what modes of translation practice might we approach Japanese literature? How
has the translation of European literature into Japanese impacted Japanese literary aesthetics
and vice versa? How might we more equitably represent Japanese literature to a global Anglo
audience? By what processes does the business of translation occur and how do those
processes impact the actual production of literary canon and study? This class requires

Judaic Studies,JUST 2014 Religious Existentialism: Christian and Jewish  (4 Credits),"Existentialism focuses on the human experience of living, often with a focus on the sheer freedom of the human condition. Religious existentialism subtly modifies this picture through its own vision of human freedom as the ultimate encounter between the human subject and God (with 'God' understood in various ways). The religious existentialist in this sense philosophically explores that which is most-fully-human as a moment of relation and encounter between self and that which is beyond self. Starting with Sartre's non-religious statement of existentialism in Existentialism is a Humanism (1946), we go on to examine the Christian and Jewish existentialisms of Kierkegaard (1813-1855), Tillich (1886-1965), Buber (1878-1965), and Heschel (1907-1972). In the course of our reflections, we compare non-religious with religious approaches to basic questions about self, God and world, and we consider the relationship between Christian and Jewish existentialist approaches to these questions.

Judaic Studies,JUST 2025 Coexistence  (4 Credits),"Building skills for ethical, emotionally-intelligent, and equity-minded encounter, this course is about facing neighbors responsively, responsibly, and non-violently—even when our values clash, and even as we work to defeat each other in the voting booth. Exploring new civic modes of “dialogue across difference” and serving as an antidote to polarization and rising tides of hate, the course invites students to consider new ways of holding onto their own views, values, and identities without erasing others—but also without necessarily embracing or being embraced by them. And it does so while helping them understand and utilize “phenomenology,” a philosophical method for assessing “lived feels” in complex relation to human meaning-making in a range of personal, professional, and political contexts. Focused in particular on interhuman coexistence, the course attends to the three-fold human cord of “our structures, our neighbors, and our selves.” It invites students to navigate between structural equity, interpersonal ethics, and personal authenticity. And it equips students to consider the “feels,” “flavors,” and “temperatures” of different coexistence strategies: from the lukewarm framework of tolerance to the warm embrace of friendship to the complicated contours of responsibility-without-friendship in such thinkers as BIPOC thought-leader Martin Luther King, Jr, philosopher and Holocaust Survivor Emmanuel Levinas, and political theorist Karl Marx. Helping students consider what sorts of coexistence goals are most and least appropriate for different contexts and why, the course asks questions like: When it comes to opponents, should we be aiming to befriend them or is it sometimes OK to set the bar lower? Should we try to “find common ground” or is it sometimes OK to “agree to disagree”? Is bridge-building always the best goal, or do we sometimes need to learn to live alongside one another without violence but also without bridges? Drawing on an inclusive reading list of BIPOC, Jewish, Islamic, Christian, African, Indigenous, and Japanese traditions, the course delves into Ubuntu principles of coexistence alongside Aztec principles of selfhood, BIPOC principles of justice alongside spiritual and atheist existentialisms, Queer Chicana feminism alongside the practice of Kintsugi, spiritual calls to love alongside political calls to respect, multicultural calls to recognition alongside social justice critiques of such calls, philosophical traditions of friendship alongside critiques of civility, and ancient wisdom traditions hand-in-hand with popular contemporary insights from Brené Brown’s work on vulnerability and Harvard’s near-century-long study of happiness. The course also explores the dangers of Islamophobia and Antisemitism; includes a visit to the campus’ Holocaust Memorial Social Action Site inspired by “radical ethics”; considers new modes of activism; and invites participants into a “Belonging and Expression” framework for navigating possibilities and tensions in important joint calls to social justice and freedom of expression.

The course aims to help participants read and understand difficult primary philosophical (and some theological) texts—many of which are cited and engaged by contemporary writings across a number of disciplines. In this respect, we work through philosophical writings related to race, exile, “negritude,” “the wandering Jew,” and “otherness” by engaging such authors as: Sartre, Wright, De Bois, Levinas, Senghor, Fanon, Freud, Appiah, Jankelevitch, and Cone, alongside Gilman’s work on the “Jew’s Body” and “Jewish Self-Hatred,” Bernasconi’s work on the phenomenology of race, and discourses of “Other-as-disease” in American and Nazi eugenics.

Judaic Studies,JUST 2202 New Testament  (4 Credits),"This course takes a multifaceted approach (historical, literary, and critical) to the writings that comprise the Christian New Testament. The New Testament are read as a collection of primary documents that chronicle the primitive Church's slow and often painful process of self-definition. In these writings it is possible to discern the tension that arose because of the strong religious and cultural ties early Christianity maintained with Palestinian Judaism, from which it emerged as a sectarian or reform movement. The careful reader also finds evidence of the new religion's encounter with the Greco-Roman world from whose variegated ethos and culture it borrowed considerably on the way to becoming an important religious force in the first century. In exploring the New Testament, then, we attempt to recover something of the sense of what it meant to be a Christian in New Testament times.

-Developing a more wholehearted and integrated self by exploring sources of fragmentation;
-Seeking a deeper understanding of identity and sense of purpose through reflection;

A significant contingent of Irish Republicans disagreed with many provisions of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and started a Civil War lasting almost a year. Struggles for Irish independence continued in many ways, most specifically with “The Troubles”, through most of the 20th Century until the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Today, Ireland maintains an open border with Northern Ireland and although peace in Northern Ireland is present, it remains tenuous with wounds that are still raw, and divisions that exist between Catholics and Protestants to this day.

Knowledge of customers is one of the cornerstones for developing sound business strategies, and there is a need to better understand the diverse aspects of consumer behavior that marketers must cater to in the global marketplace. As the study of consumer behavior draws upon marketing, psychology, economics, anthropology, and other disciplines, the added complexity of understanding it beyond ones’ home market results in additional challenges and opportunities. Consumer behavior attempts to understand the consumption activities of individuals as opposed to markets, and as this course will demonstrate, consumption activities are not universal. The course will focus on both consumer behavior theory, as well as the integration of regional, global, and cultural variables that marketers must account for in developing marketing programs in strategies. Topics such as global consumer culture, values and consumption, international consumer attributes, international social and mental processes, will be used to help comprehend and explain the convergence and divergence of consumer behavior in the global marketplace. The goal of this course is to provide a more concrete understanding of how marketers account for similarities and differences in the development and implementation of marketing practices, in the field of advertising, product and service development and usage, retailing, and communications.

What do writer Isabel Allende, dancer Twyla Tharp, soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, Apple inventor Steve Jobs, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and the artist formerly known as Prince have in common? What is required to do life-changing work? Inspiration or Perspiration? The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People? Can everyone be a virtuoso, genius, or prodigy? Through shared assignments, the class will discuss performances and research in four different areas: “Practice and Work Habits”; “Mindfulness Techniques”; “Performance Anxiety, Stage Fright, and other Mental Blocks”; and “Flow”. Videos, podcasts, live performances, trade paperbacks, websites, and academic research will inform our understanding of these topics. In addition, each student will develop two personal projects—one on cultural attitudes towards mastery, and one on a specific technique for creating better work routines, overcoming stage fright, or maintaining focus. Students from different disciplines will share their ideas with peers. Throughout, each class member will keep a daily journal, culminating in a final reflection that charts progress over the quarter. By the end of the quarter, students will integrate their research with new skills and greater awareness of their own path towards achievement.

Music-Academic Classes,MUAC 3023 Rhythm & Meter in Music  (4 Credits),"Rhythm pertains to experienced or measured durations in music. Meter pertains to the cyclic organization of music’s durations. A hegemonic view of meter emerged in music theory and related disciplines in the mid-20th century, one most appropriate to Western classical music and, to a lesser extent, Anglo-American popular music. This view holds that meter “in music” consists of (1) hierarchically arranged beats (2) whose durations are nominally equivalent and (3) whose onsets among coordinated musicians are nominally aligned. This course examines rhythm and meter by interrogating three components of the standard view of the topic. Looking at Western classical music, but also traditional and commercial music from Africa and the African diaspora, we will explore the nature of meter and rhythm in music where durations might not be arranged hierarchically, of equal length, or aligned.",4,Unknown

We look at how the Cuban government has embraced rap music as emblematic of the nation’s revolutionary ethos; how the United States government used jazz as a diplomatic tool during the Cold War; how NGOs in Israel and Palestine used popular and classical musics to promote peace and understanding; how American courts have used rap music as evidence in criminal cases; and how funding and intellectual property laws impact musical ownership, tradition, innovation, and creativity.

Music-Academic Classes,MUAC 3544 Music and Activism  (4 Credits),"In many times and places, people around the world sing, chant, and drum in the streets. Their lived experiences don't line up with the equality and opportunity their governments claim to champion. Music is an integral part of their advocacy work. They play and sing as they draw attention to injustices, foster cohesion and community, communicate messages (both covertly and forcefully), express pain, joy and pride, energize and sustain themselves, as well as (de)humanize themselves and others. This course explores the special place music has in activism around the world. We examine protest movements such as the South African anti-apartheid movement, the American Abolitionist and Civil Rights movements, American/European White Nationalist movements, the Arab Spring, and the worldwide Black Lives Matter movements. We will explore community music projects with social justice agendas such as Youth on Record, The Spirituals Project, and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra. We ask, why is music a particularly important part of activist work? What special place does it have? How is it used for both good and bad? For community mobilization, peace, and violence? Drawing on the fields of ethnomusicology, musicology, and cultural policy, we explore music, not just as a means to achieve certain ends, but as integral to the way humans position themselves in the world and advocate for themselves and others.

Philosophy,PHIL 1610 Discovering Philosophy  (4 Credits),In this course we explore a range of philosophical questions and examine the replies that have been made by historical figures.  We also think through the methods and strategies that have been used for thinking through those replies and explore these questions further on our own.  Topics may include how do we know what actions are moral?  What is knowledge?  What is the basic structure of the world? What is justice? What assumptions are made by the disciplines that take themselves to study the natural world?

Philosophy,PHIL 2003 Philosophy and Popular Culture  (4 Credits),"This course critically explores philosophical questions and issues in the context of contemporary popular culture. On the one hand, it considers more general questions about the nature and function of popular culture, including how popular culture has been defined and ""theorized""; the connections between popular culture and the traditional and new media; the economic bases and functions of popular culture; and the political implications of popular culture. On the other, it explores particular philosophical issues--historical, ethical, political, aesthetic, and metaphysical--as they appear in selected areas or examples of popular culture: literature, film, the visual arts, digital media, graphic novels, music, television, etc. The aims are both to enhance students' critical understanding of the ways in which philosophical assumptions and ideas underlie popular culture and to present traditional and contemporary philosophical arguments, movements, and ideas using examples drawn from popular culture as reference points. As examples, we might explore ethical dilemmas posed in the ""Sopranos"" or ""Mad Men""; mind-body problems in the ""Matrix"" or ""Avatar""; or metaphysical issues in ""Donny Darko"" or ""Run, Lola, Run."" This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement.",4,Unknown
Philosophy,PHIL 2004 Philosophy of Race  (4 Credits),"This course is a systematic study of the scientific, metaphysical, ethical, and political issues surrounding the notion of race. We undertake a critical study of the following questions: Is race a scientifically legitimate concept, or is it a social construct? Is race a legitimate census category? How should questions of race be decided, and by whom? Why do we think of humans in terms of race--for evolutionary or psychological reasons? Religious reasons? What is racism? Why is racism morally wrong? What do psychological studies show about our racist tendencies? Does affirmative action provide a morally acceptable way of achieving racial justice? What race is a mixed race person? This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement.",4,Unknown
Philosophy,PHIL 2005 Philosophy of Religion  (4 Credits),"What is God? Can God be known or is faith precisely a relationship to something that cannot be known in the ordinary sense? What is the relationship between God and morality? Between God and science? Is it more reasonable to believe that your religion is the only path to God or more reasonable to believe that God is manifest in many ways across different cultures? Is it reasonable to believe in God at all? If it is reasonable to believe in God, what are the reasons? And if believing in God is not based on reasons in the ordinary sense, are there philosophical grounds for believing in God anyway? This course takes a ""God friendly"" approach to philosophical questions about religion, setting out to investigate ontological and epistemological questions about belief-in-God toward the goal of understanding different ways that philosophers over the years have philosophically gone about developing, upholding, and talking about relationship with God. The course includes consideration of philosophers from analytic and continental traditions, from American and European schools of thought, from ancient, medieval, modern and post-modern traditions, and from Greek, Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions. Thinkers to be addressed include Pascal, Anselm, Plantinga, Van Inwagen, Hick, Hume, Descartes, Spinoza, Plato, Aristotle, Ibn Tufayl, Averroes, Maimonides, James, Levinas, Marion, Badiou, Rosenzweig, Aquinas, Buber, Cohen, Mill, Lycan, Kant, Wittgenstein, Kierkegaard, and Kafka.

Philosophy,PHIL 2008 Stereotyping and Violence in America Today  (4 Credits),"This course is cross-listed withJUST 2008,COMN 2008,RLGS 2008. This course offers students the opportunity to explore key issues relating to diversity and inclusion in the contemporary United States, focusing on the themes of stereotyping and violence, from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Students will engage with scholarly and popular culture artifacts to examine the kinds of stereotyping and types of violence, visible and invisible, that characterize and challenge political, social, cultural, economic, religious, and educational life in today’s United States, and will do so by working with the course instructor as well as faculty members from across the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Students will work together to connect the given week’s speaker’s assigned readings and insights to readings and insights from previous weeks’ speakers; assignments and classroom discussion will in this way be very interdisciplinary and will compare and contrast multiple diverse points of view and disciplinary lenses on the question of stereotyping and violence.

Philosophy,PHIL 2014 Religious Existentialism: Christian and Jewish  (4 Credits),"Existentialism focuses on the human experience of living, often with a focus on the sheer freedom of the human condition. Religious existentialism subtly modifies this picture through its own vision of human freedom as the ultimate encounter between the human subject and God (with 'God' understood in various ways). The religious existentialist in this sense philosophically explores that which is most-fully-human as a moment of relation and encounter between self and that which is beyond self. Starting with Sartre's non-religious statement of existentialism in Existentialism is a Humanism (1946), we go on to examine the Christian and Jewish existentialisms of Kierkegaard (1813-1855), Tillich (1886-1965), Buber (1878-1965), and Heschel (1907-1972). In the course of our reflections, we compare non-religious with religious approaches to basic questions about self, God and world, and we consider the relationship between Christian and Jewish existentialist approaches to these questions.

Philosophy,PHIL 2025 Coexistence  (4 Credits),"Building skills for ethical, emotionally-intelligent, and equity-minded encounter, this course is about facing neighbors responsively, responsibly, and non-violently—even when our values clash, and even as we work to defeat each other in the voting booth. Exploring new civic modes of “dialogue across difference” and serving as an antidote to polarization and rising tides of hate, the course invites students to consider new ways of holding onto their own views, values, and identities without erasing others—but also without necessarily embracing or being embraced by them. And it does so while helping them understand and utilize “phenomenology,” a philosophical method for assessing “lived feels” in complex relation to human meaning-making in a range of personal, professional, and political contexts. Focused in particular on interhuman coexistence, the course attends to the three-fold human cord of “our structures, our neighbors, and our selves.” It invites students to navigate between structural equity, interpersonal ethics, and personal authenticity. And it equips students to consider the “feels,” “flavors,” and “temperatures” of different coexistence strategies: from the lukewarm framework of tolerance to the warm embrace of friendship to the complicated contours of responsibility-without-friendship in such thinkers as BIPOC thought-leader Martin Luther King, Jr, philosopher and Holocaust Survivor Emmanuel Levinas, and political theorist Karl Marx. Helping students consider what sorts of coexistence goals are most and least appropriate for different contexts and why, the course asks questions like: When it comes to opponents, should we be aiming to befriend them or is it sometimes OK to set the bar lower? Should we try to “find common ground” or is it sometimes OK to “agree to disagree”? Is bridge-building always the best goal, or do we sometimes need to learn to live alongside one another without violence but also without bridges? Drawing on an inclusive reading list of BIPOC, Jewish, Islamic, Christian, African, Indigenous, and Japanese traditions, the course delves into Ubuntu principles of coexistence alongside Aztec principles of selfhood, BIPOC principles of justice alongside spiritual and atheist existentialisms, Queer Chicana feminism alongside the practice of Kintsugi, spiritual calls to love alongside political calls to respect, multicultural calls to recognition alongside social justice critiques of such calls, philosophical traditions of friendship alongside critiques of civility, and ancient wisdom traditions hand-in-hand with popular contemporary insights from Brené Brown’s work on vulnerability and Harvard’s near-century-long study of happiness. The course also explores the dangers of Islamophobia and Antisemitism; includes a visit to the campus’ Holocaust Memorial Social Action Site inspired by “radical ethics”; considers new modes of activism; and invites participants into a “Belonging and Expression” framework for navigating possibilities and tensions in important joint calls to social justice and freedom of expression.This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement.

Philosophy,"PHIL 2026 Race: Black, Jew, Other  (4 Credits)","In its investigation of philosophical writings on race and racism, this course explores a range of existential and phenomenological lenses for interrogating race and racism, with a focus on the shared theoretical and practical intersections of anti-Black and anti-Jew discourse. The course aims to help participants read and understand difficult primary philosophical (and some theological) texts—many of which are cited and engaged by contemporary writings across a number of disciplines. In this respect, we work through philosophical writings related to race, exile, “negritude,” “the wandering Jew,” and “otherness” by engaging such authors as: Sartre, Wright, De Bois, Levinas, Senghor, Fanon, Freud, Appiah, Jankelevitch, and Cone, alongside Gilman’s work on the “Jew’s Body” and “Jewish Self-Hatred,” Bernasconi’s work on the phenomenology of race, and discourses of “Other-as-disease” in American and Nazi eugenics. In all of its content, the course aims to engage participants with key issues and questions around race and racism, including extending the implications of anti-Black and anti-Jew discourses / practices to a range of other anti-Other discourses / practices at play in the world around us.

Philosophy,PHIL 2110 Classical Greek Philosophy  (4 Credits),"The philosophical thought of classical Greece that developed between about 500 and 300 BCE is the basis of all subsequent European philosophy and, arguably, of European culture itself. Besides its indisputable historical importance, it is also rich in ideas and insights that are as striking and relevant today as they were over 2000 years ago. This course serves as an introduction to this seminal period of philosophy, its historical and cultural context, and in fact, to philosophy itself. In the course, we focus primarily on the teachings of Socrates, the dialogues of his student Plato, and the writings of Plato's student Aristotle. In addition, we begin by considering the cultural and intellectual context, including the Homeric epics and the tragedies, that enabled such thinkers to arise and concludes with a brief look at the paths Greek philosophy took after the ""Golden Age of Greece' has passed.

Philosophy,PHIL 2145 Between Deleuze and Foucault  (4 Credits),"Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault are widely accepted to be central figures of post-war French philosophy. Philosophers, cultural theorists, and others have devoted considerable effort to the critical examination of the work of each of these thinkers, but despite the strong biographical and philosophical connection between Foucault and Deleuze, very little has been done to explore the relationship between them. This course addresses the critical deficit by providing rigorous comparative discussions of the work of these two philosophers. The relationship between Foucault and Deleuze, however, is as strong as it is disparate: it is perhaps best described as a parallelism. As Deleuze says, “I never worked with Foucault. But I do think there are a lot of parallels between our work (with Guattari) and his, although they are, as it were, held at a distance because of our widely differing methods and even our objectives.” While the two were drawn together through their novel readings of Nietzsche, their commitment to a non-teleological theory of history, their activism in contemporary politics (with prisons, ’68, Palestine, etc.), their return to the stoics, and a theory of the event, Deleuze and Foucault were often decisively divided in their methods and motivations. Through primary and secondary readings, this course focuses on the similarities and differences in between these two thinkers.

Philosophy,PHIL 2181 Aesthetics & Philosophy of Art  (4 Credits),"Although critical reflection about art goes back at least to Plato, developments both in modern philosophy and in the arts themselves have produced an unprecedented, intense, and ongoing dialogue between artists and philosophers that has deeply affected the practices of both. Just as modern philosophers have come to view the arts as vitally important ways of experiencing and knowing, so modern artists have drawn heavily on philosophical ideas and views in creating their own works. The focus of this course is on some of the major ways in which new developments in the arts have influenced philosophical thought and have, in turn, been influenced by it. In particular, we consider some of the most representative artworks (many contemporary) that have raised the question, ""Why is this art?,"" together with the major philosophical and critical theories that have attempted to respond to this question. Besides discussing specific works of art, we read and discuss some of the major statements and theories about them by both classical and contemporary philosophers, art historians and critics, and the artists themselves. This course is of interest both to students of philosophy wishing to explore contemporary developments in the arts as well as to art and art history students interested in a deeper understanding of the philosophical views that underlie so much modern and contemporary art.

Film remains one of the most popular cultural expressions and dramatizations of these questions.",4,Unknown
Philosophy,PHIL 2186 Feminist Ethics: Justice and Care  (4 Credits),"In the late 1950’s psychologists began to theorize a notion of human moral development and they created instruments with which to measure such development. By the 1970’s there were claims that even well-educated women were—on average—stunted in their moral competence according to these measures. Once a sufficient number of women were engaged in moral theory in both psychology and philosophy, they began to diagnose these theories and instruments as prejudiced by what we would today call ‘while, cisgender, male privilege.’ The scales were centering a detached notion of justice and equality for all, whereas researchers found that women centered notions of care and engaged in relational (rather than detached) thinking when asked ethical questions. Thus, was born the discipline of Feminist Ethics. While many women (and some men) celebrated the alternative ‘ethics of care’ over an ‘ethics of justice,’ others worried that these women had been harmed by their male dominated society and were showing signs of a ‘slave mentality’ in their moral reasoning that was to be overcome and not celebrated. Predictably (in hindsight), women of color complained that their perspective was not taken into account by these ‘caring’ white female professors. In this class we will look at this conversation as it unfolded. In the process we will evaluate these theories from a philosophical perspective and see which parts seem most helpful for thinking about current ethical issues. Many or all of the readings were probably written before you were born. In fact, there is very little philosophical literature that labels itself ‘feminist ethics’ or ‘ethics of care’ that was written in the 21st century. We will ponder why this is the case. Are these ideas outdated, or have they been sufficiently incorporated into mainstream academic thinking that they no longer wear the label of marginalization?

Philosophy,PHIL 2555 The Philosophy of Technology  (4 Credits),"Serious thought about technology commences with the beginnings of philosophy itself, although it becomes an urgent theme and explicit field of philosophical inquiry only in the 20th century. This course will approach the theme of technology from five perspectives: (1) Historical: How did technology arise as a philosophical concern and how did the development of technology influence thought about it? (2) Metaphysical: What role does technology play in our understanding of ‘reality’? Is technology one element among others in what we take to be ‘real,’ or does it determine our views of ‘reality’? (3) Epistemological: What is the relation between science and technology? Is technology a result or application of ‘scientific knowledge,’ or does technology govern or drive science itself? (4) Ethical/Political: In what ways does technology influence and/or challenge our views about what is ‘valuable’ about our individual and collective ways of living? Is the development of technology something to be embraced or rejected/limited with respect to human values and aspirations? (5) ‘Futurist’: Can the ‘digital revolution’ be understood as continuous with the history of technology itself or does it represent some new metamorphosis of both what it means to be ‘human’ and of ‘reality’ itself?

The course explores how the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the pressures of an incipient modernity impacted the style, direction and substance of Wittgenstein’s thought, developments that had profound existential and spiritual import for him as he wrestled with the many contradictions of his life and thought. The course concludes with a consideration of the relationship between Wittgenstein’s later philosophy and the existential-phenomenology of Martin Heidegger, both of whom insist upon humanity’s radical finitude and the pre-ontological understanding (forms of life) that always already conditions and guides our questions about reason, truth, beauty and meaning.",4,Beginner

Philosophy,PHIL 3446 Philosophy in the American Tradition  (4 Credits),"The course introduces students to the thought of the three premier American Transcendentalist writers: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, and Henry David Thoreau. These three writers—by turns friends, rivals, neighbors, and even housemates in nearby Concord, Massachusetts— created what Emerson called “a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition” and laid the foundations for American philosophy and literature as we know it today. They also led the first countercultural movement in American history, advocating causes as varied as environmentalism, abolitionism, women’s rights, and the “higher law” of the individual conscience in an age of unbridled capitalism and populism. We will consider the Transcendentalists as both writers and reformers, examining their calls for a uniquely American literature and their romantic sacralization of nature as well as their deep commitment to reform and their engagement with the turbulent politics of their time. In the final weeks of the course, we will explore the Transcendentalists’ profound influence on American cultural history, ranging from their contemporaries (Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and Nathaniel Hawthorne) to ours (Marilynne Robinson, Terrence Malick, and W. S. Merwin).",4,Beginner

Philosophy,PHIL 3611 The Boundaries of Scientific Knowledge: A Philosophical Exploration  (4 Credits),"Despite its staggering successes, public trust in science is disquietingly low. What has gone wrong? Why is a substantive portion of the population unwilling to trust the advice of specialists? A central problem lies in the tendency of scientists, philosophers, and various pundits to hype, bloat, and overemphasize the promises and results of scientific research. This leads to scientism, broadly conceived as the imperialist tendency to reduce all knowledge to scientific knowledge. But what exactly is scientism? Despite the pejorative connotation of the term, is it an intellectual sin or a virtue? The aim of this course is to map the terrain, exploring various dimensions of scientism, and how it affects the public dimensions of scientific research and its relation to the humanities, religion, and other domains of knowledge, culture, and society.",4,Unknown
Philosophy,PHIL 3612 AI and Robotics  (4 Credits),"In this interdisciplinary seminar we will discuss foundational issues regarding artificially intelligent systems. We will seek to understand how recent advances in AI research bear on our understanding of the nature of the mind, intelligence, agency, rationality, and consciousness. We will also discuss how philosophical advances can advance empirical progress. Additionally, we will discuss some barriers to progress that these technologies might pose. In particular, we will be focused on three groups of questions: 1. What special opportunities and challenges are presented by deep neural net and deep learning technology regarding building and understanding artificially minded intelligent agents? 2. What is the role of the body and environment in producing intelligence? 3. Deep neural net algorithms are already commonly used to predict recidivism rates, diagnose illnesses, and make advertising more effective. In what ways might such algorithms be approaching human or animal intelligence, or shed light on such intelligence? In what ways might human and animal intelligence be importantly different? In what ways might contemporary intelligence research perpetuate injustice and oppression?

Philosophy,PHIL 3620 Philosophical Perspectives on Economics and Social Sciences  (4 Credits),"This course provides an advanced survey of conceptual and methodological issues that lie at the intersection of philosophy, economics, and the social sciences. More specifically, the main goal is to engage in a critical discussion of how sciences such as psychology, sociology, and neuroscience can challenge and modify the foundations and methodology of economic theories. The course is structured around three broad modules. After a brief introduction, we begin by discussing the emergence of rational choice theory which constitutes the foundation of classical and neoclassical economics and present some paradoxical implications of expected utility theory. The second module focuses on the relationship between economics and psychology. More specifically, we examine the emergence of behavioral economics, the study of the social, cognitive, and emotional factors on the economic decisions of individuals and institutions and their consequences for market prices, returns, and resource allocation. Finally, the third module focuses on the implications of neuroscience on decision making. We discuss some recent developments in neuroeconomics, a field of study emerged over the last few decades which seeks to ground economic theory in the study of neural mechanisms which are expressed mathematically and make behavioral predictions.",4,Advanced

The class is a place-based exercise revolving around the idea that what we know about our surroundings depends on how we “see” or “sense.” We will examine various aspects of nature specific to the Kennedy Mountain Campus (KMC) using both micro and macro approaches to “seeing” through a variety of technologies, including microscopes, trail cameras, photo and video cameras, night vision glasses, and telescopes. To develop the concept of “sensing,” we will explore the soundscapes of the KMC as well as the ways plants and animals endemic to this ecosystem sense their surroundings. We will also explore using human senses other than sight to navigate the nighttime environment.

Physics & Astronomy,PHYS 3350 Physics and Information  (4 Credits),"Students in Physical Sciences are often well versed in the art of model building but less so in the process of model-selection when multiple models can describe the same data. Students rarely learn tools beyond curve fitting and least square error minimization for model selection. Consequently, students are often unaware of the scope of different tools and fail to make judicious choice of algorithms/theories when faced with diverse problems. For example, building a model from data is very different from generating data (stochastic or deterministic) from a model. Next consider two contrasting challenges of model building i) when there is limited data vs ii) when there is too much data. For the first problem -- inferring models from limited data -- the solution can be traced back to Boltzmann's formulation of Statistical Physics describing motion of atoms. The connection between Information theory, Inference and Boltzmann's description, however, is often overlooked in introductory or even advanced classes in Physics, and Statistics. Studying these similarities can unlock novel solutions for problems well outside of thermodynamics, even as far as Image processing, Biology and Network science. Inference also requires us to appreciate fundamental topics in Probability -- difference between frequentist and non-frequentist approach, Bayesian formalism -- that are rarely taught to physical scientists, life scientists or engineers. At the other extreme, faced with data deluge, we routinely ask: how do we make sense of too much data ? We use clustering, PCA, Neural Networks. In this course we will discuss and connect all these seemingly disparate concepts and apply them -- at the appropriate context -- to diverse problems in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and beyond. In the process we will gain an in-depth knowledge about commonly heard but perhaps less understood topics such as: Entropy, Likelihood maximization, Bayesian statistics, PCA, Classification algorithms, and Neural Networks. We will also address another often overlooked but fundamental and fascinating topic, biology's inherent ability to encode and decode information. Currently there is no such course that address all these topics in Information and Data Science in an unified manner -- deeply connecting their formal basis, regime of applicability -- grounded on physical principles, with a forward looking approach towards application in many areas well outside of traditional sciences. A lot of learning in the course will happen `on the fly', where the tools and application problems are learnt as needed. Prerequisites: Calculus I, Calculus II, and at least two other courses focusing on application of mathematics to problems in physics/chemistry/biology or engineering.

As the traditional story goes, the country has been locked in a high-stakes and highly controversial fight over abortion since the Supreme Court legalized access in 1973 via the Roe v. Wade decision. While a convenient story, it egregiously oversimplifies both the past and present of abortion politics and law.

Political Science,PLSC 2250 Democratic Erosion: Comparing Experiences Across Countries and Over Time  (4 Credits),"As the conclusion of the Cold War spurred a tidal wave of democratization around the globe, western policy makers and pundits often assumed that even in weak, poverty-impacted states attempts to democratize were bound to succeed – at least eventually. By 2008, however, the discourse of democratization had been transformed. “Celebrations of democracy’s triumph are premature,” wrote a noted scholar of democratization; “in a few short years, the democratic wave has been slowed by a powerful authoritarian undertow.” Recently, both the quality and quantity of “democratic” states have declined. Even the world’s oldest, most taken-for-granted liberal democratic regimes increasingly flout democratic norms and policies. We consider a range of comparative cases from across world regions. Along the way, we engage with several prominent theories of democratic backsliding or authoritarianization.

Religious Studies,RLGS 2005 Philosophy of Religion  (4 Credits),"What is God? Can God be known or is faith precisely a relationship to something that cannot be known in the ordinary sense? What is the relationship between God and morality? Between God and science? Is it more reasonable to believe that your religion is the only path to God or more reasonable to believe that God is manifest in many ways across different cultures? Is it reasonable to believe in God at all? If it is reasonable to believe in God, what are the reasons? And if believing in God is not based on reasons in the ordinary sense, are there philosophical grounds for believing in God anyway? This course takes a ""God friendly"" approach to philosophical questions about religion, setting out to investigate ontological and epistemological questions about belief-in-God toward the goal of understanding different ways that philosophers over the years have philosophically gone about developing, upholding, and talking about relationship with God. The course includes consideration of philosophers from analytic and continental traditions, from American and European schools of thought, from ancient, medieval, modern and post-modern traditions, and from Greek, Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions. Thinkers to be addressed include Pascal, Anselm, Plantinga, Van Inwagen, Hick, Hume, Descartes, Spinoza, Plato, Aristotle, Ibn Tufayl, Averroes, Maimonides, James, Levinas, Marion, Badiou, Rosenzweig, Aquinas, Buber, Cohen, Mill, Lycan, Kant, Wittgenstein, Kierkegaard, and Kafka.

Religious Studies,"RLGS 2011 Religion, Environmentalism, and Politics  (4 Credits)","How does religion mediate the relationship between people and the natural world? How do different religious traditions understand and interpret the natural world and humans’ responsibility to and for it? Is it possible to reconcile an understanding of the world as divinely created with human destruction of the environment—and, if not, then what are the political consequences? In this course, we will consider a variety of disciplinary approaches to topics related to religion, environmentalism, and politics, taking Abrahamic and indigenous religions as our key examples. From urban gardening to green Islam to Standing Rock to eco-feminism, we’ll use theories about religion and culture to understand the complex intersections of faith, policy, and planetary crisis. The course includes a community engagement component that will bring us to a local faith-based urban farm where we will discuss course texts as we help prepare for the 2020 growing season.

Religious Studies,RLGS 2012 Jewish Politics and Political Jews in the United States  (4 Credits),"Milton Himmelfarb famously quipped that “Jews earn like Episcopalians, and vote like Puerto Ricans.” This statement captures the surprising loyalty of American Jews to liberalism and the Democratic party despite the group’s significant socioeconomic achievement in the post-World War II era. This course considers Jewish political behavior in the United States through a variety of disciplinary lenses. Our study will be enriched through archival research in the Beck archives (held at DU) and through conversations with local political figures.

Religious Studies,RLGS 2014 Religious Existentialism: Christian and Jewish  (4 Credits),"Existentialism focuses on the human experience of living, often with a focus on the sheer freedom of the human condition. Religious existentialism subtly modifies this picture through its own vision of human freedom as the ultimate encounter between the human subject and God (with 'God' understood in various ways). The religious existentialist in this sense philosophically explores that which is most-fully-human as a moment of relation and encounter between self and that which is beyond self. Starting with Sartre's non-religious statement of existentialism in Existentialism is a Humanism (1946), we go on to examine the Christian and Jewish existentialisms of Kierkegaard (1813-1855), Tillich (1886-1965), Buber (1878-1965), and Heschel (1907-1972). In the course of our reflections, we compare non-religious with religious approaches to basic questions about self, God and world, and we consider the relationship between Christian and Jewish existentialist approaches to these questions.

It will also explore from a theoretical standpoint certain social, political, and economic factors that explain the development and historical persistence of imperial governance as well as the role of religion in both preserving and undermining empire. It will also touch on the phenomenon of “religious nationalism” in these processes.

Religious Studies,"RLGS 2025 Race, Social Justice, and Religion in the US Public Square  (4 Credits)","The US public square is a fundamental aspect of civic engagement and identity construction. This course uses the lenses of race and social justice to explore how religious expression impacts the cultural, social, political, and personal narratives/discourses that comprise the modern public square. We will consider public spaces in the context of anti-Asian and anti-Black racism as well as Islamophobia and the intersectional privileges and prejudices these communities negotiate. Issues such as immigration, borders, racialization, entrenched beliefs and traditions dovetailing with structural racism in the American context will be discussed each through video modules from the Interfaith Youth Core along with supplemental readings. By centering the lived practices and discourses through which access and agency is forged within public spaces (material and virtual), I want students to learn how they are both participants in and makers of these spaces. This course asks students to interrogate the ways in which their personal identities intersectionally determine how public spaces are constructed, which public spaces we enter, and how we participate in those spaces.

The course aims to help participants read and understand difficult primary philosophical (and some theological) texts—many of which are cited and engaged by contemporary writings across a number of disciplines. In this respect, we work through philosophical writings related to race, exile, “negritude,” “the wandering Jew,” and “otherness” by engaging such authors as: Sartre, Wright, De Bois, Levinas, Senghor, Fanon, Freud, Appiah, Jankelevitch, and Cone, alongside Gilman’s work on the “Jew’s Body” and “Jewish Self-Hatred,” Bernasconi’s work on the phenomenology of race, and discourses of “Other-as-disease” in American and Nazi eugenics.

Taking the premise that America is a Jewish center as its key organizing principle, this course introduces and challenges theories of diaspora and looks at American Jewry’s religious and institutional innovations. The course will proceed inductively, taking Denver-based resources and experiences as starting points for an expansive exploration of American Jewish life, culture, and religion.

Religious Studies,"RLGS 2102 Judaism, Christianity & Islam  (4 Credits)","This course introduces students to the three major monotheistic religious traditions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In the process of tracing the long and rich histories of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, we examine the beliefs and practices that became central and definitive for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. We begin with the ancient heritage of each religion (scriptures, founders, early institutions). Then we explore how these foundational traditions were preserved and re-invigorated in response to centuries of social change and critical moments of political upheaval. Most significant, in this regard, is the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim encounter with their respective holy Scriptures--as generation after generation of adherents have attempted to understand the revealed words of God, to proclaim their continual relevance for all places and all times and to inscribe them upon their bodies and hearts through prayer, worship, and daily life.

Religious Studies,RLGS 2104 The Bible as Literature  (4 Credits),"The Bible has been one of the most important works in all of Western society. In this course we read the Bible as a masterpiece of literature.  Rather than focusing on theological questions about this work as inspired scripture, we instead focus on its rich literary qualities and explore some ways in which these stories have influenced modern society.  Reading select passages, we discuss its literary genres, forms, symbols and motifs, many of which are important in literature today.  Of the latter, we encounter stories of creation and hero tales, parables, apocalyptic literature, and themes of paradise and the loss of Eden, wilderness, covenant, and the promised land.

Religious Studies,RLGS 2112 Major Islamic Thinkers 1900s-2000s  (4 Credits),"This course offers students a substantive introduction to major Islamic thinkers of the 20th and 21st centuries. Starting with Abu `Ala Maududi, whose work on Qur'anic interpretation and the meaning of jihad laid the groundwork for new waves of radical activism in the modern Muslim world, this course exposes students to the works of ""movers and shakers"" like Sayyid Qutb and Ayotollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Students engage these thinkers through a mix of primary and secondary sources, developing a sense of context as they work through their arguments. The course continues with some of the major later 20th-century Islamic thinkers active in Muslim-minority spaces, focusing on Bosnian Grand Mufti Mustafa Ceric and the Moroccan-French scholar Mohammed Arkoun. It concludes by looking at two major figures of the early 21st century, noting how they blend intellectual and political activism: Iranian cleric Mohsen Kadivar and American scholar Amina Wadud.

Religious Studies,RLGS 2116 American Mythology  (4 Credits),"Myths convey social and moral values. Myths, moreover, serve as conceptual models for society and furnish ""symbolic articulation of the social patterns"" of a given society. In this class, students will establish clear connections between social order and the myths that sustain it, against the view that myths are merely imaginary, misguided perceptions of reality with little social value. In this course, you will need to ask yourself, ""How do each of these myths translate into social behavior? In other words, how have these myths been acted out historically and how are they ""performed"" today? The United States of America has always had a strong, mythic sense of identity, mission, and destiny. It is worthwhile to reflect for a semester on how the ""idea of America"" has taken shape and is continuing to evolve and diversify. Robert Bellah introduced the influential concept of an American ""civil religion""--a secular myth of America. In addition, we must understand that America is the result of contact between at least three different groups of people: Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans. The functional equivalents of creed, scripture, prophets and religious mission are seen in the Declaration of Independence, the Founding Fathers and Manifest Destiny. Concepts of freedom, the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness, democracy, and the right to bear arms flow from these myths. Beyond the notion of a master myth of America, we will discover that there are other myths of America that are themselves proper objects of study.

Religious Studies,"RLGS 2119 Caste, Race and Colonialism  (4 Credits)","This course explores intersections of social, political, and personal structures that shape the various identities we hold. We have chosen three categories: caste, race, and colonialism, to showcase how identities emerge as unique intersectional sites of contestation and negotiation between individual difference, historical context for how to understand that difference, and the ways social/political structures valorize difference. To foreground lived experience in the construction of identity, our course will draw on a number of resources including: blogs, opinion pieces, podcasts, peer-reviewed articles, selections from books, documentaries and film, and social media both within and outside the US. The goal of this course is to encourage students to consider how “identity” and “privilege” are contingent terms that operate on multiple levels (e.g. personal, social, and political) and help uncover the networks of vulnerability, power, and access/accessibility that inform identity. Furthermore, we invite students to engage with these terms through practical assessments (e.g. producing a podcast) in order for them to “see” how they both produce and are “produced” by the various public squares in which they participate. Students will deconstruct the categories of caste, race, and colonialism in the context of socio-political and cultural structures (e.g. religion, gender identity, ability, political beliefs, etc.) We ask students to consider the following questions: In what ways, do these categories shape our personal and public identities? How do these categories work within contemporary public and private spaces? This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement.",4,Unknown
Religious Studies,RLGS 2202 New Testament  (4 Credits),"This course takes a multifaceted approach (historical, literary, and critical) to the writings that comprise the Christian New Testament. The New Testament are read as a collection of primary documents that chronicle the primitive Church’s slow and often painful process of self-definition. In these writings it is possible to discern the tension that arose because of the strong religious and cultural ties early Christianity maintained with Palestinian Judaism, from which it emerged as a sectarian or reform movement. The careful reader also finds evidence of the new religion’s encounter with the Greco-Roman world from whose variegated ethos and culture it borrowed considerably on the way to becoming an important religious force in the first century. In exploring the New Testament, then, we attempt to recover something of the sense of what it meant to be a Christian in New Testament times.

Religious Studies,"RLGS 2205 Women, Gender, and the Bible  (4 Credits)","From Eve to Mary Magdalene, women play essential roles in biblical texts. While many courses, books, and Bible studies focus primarily on men, this course will focus women included in biblical and apocryphal texts as well as the way the Bible has been used to regulate gender in society, leadership, churches, and homes. Feminist and womanist biblical criticism will be used throughout this course, as will a focus on gender critical readings. Through critical reading and reflection on both primary texts and secondary texts, students will form their own views of the representations of female characters, named and unnamed, in the Bible. Additionally, students will ponder the ways that these texts still affect women today. This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement.",4,Unknown
Religious Studies,RLGS 2250 Introduction to African American Religions  (4 Credits),"This course will explore the nature and the meaning of black religion. We will examine the historical development of African American religion in the United States and explore diverse African American religious groups, such as the Nation of Islam, the Moorish Science Temple of America, Black Jews of Harlem, and others. Specific attention is given to the ways in which African American religious groups have developed in North America, especially the United States and the Caribbean, during slavery and beyond. The course will have three sections. First, we will attempt to define religion in the larger context of religious studies. Second, we will investigate how black religions and black religious scholars deploy Africa as a deep symbol. Finally, we will survey the historical and theological development of a variety of black religions that have been influential in North America.

Religious Studies,RLGS 2301 American Indian Religion  (4 Credits),"This course will provide an overview of the religious beliefs and practices, histories, cultures, and contemporary lives of the Native American communities in the Rocky Mountains (Ute) as well as those commonly referred to as the “Great Plains Indians” (primarily the Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Sioux, and Crow). Made up of thirty different tribes with seven different language groups, Plains Indians constitute a diverse range of languages, customs, social structures, and religious beliefs. As we learn about the various worldviews and lifeways of Rocky Mountain and Plains Indians peoples, we will also explore the relationships between religion and culture, religion and society, religion and land, and religion and conflict. We will watch several films covering a variety of Native American issues. This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement.",4,Unknown
Religious Studies,RLGS 2303 Lived Religions  (4 Credits),"The concept of “lived religions” has become prominent in religious studies since the 2000’s. While people may think of religions as sets of sacred writings, rules, and rituals, the “lived religions” approach focuses on the ways that people incorporate religion into their activities. The approach is new enough that scholars have not yet come to full agreement on what the term “lived religions” should include and what it implies about religions and how to study them. The course will make room, therefore, to debate the advantages and drawbacks of studying religions through the ways people use religion to shape their life. Students will examine examples of how people live their religion and trace the relationships of these practices to religious teachings and ideas. This effort will involve asking a variety of questions. How closely are religious practices related to teachings and ideas? Does a specific religion put greater emphasis on engaging in specific activities or on agreeing with particular teachings? If people’s behavior does not fit with a religion’s teachings but the people still consider it to be related to key aspects of religion, does it count as religious? Or have these people moved away from religion into a practice that is spiritually meaningful but not religious? Or is spirituality something even more sharply different from religion? Or is spirituality also part of religion? If we look closely at how people in a religious tradition live, what do we see that we would not notice if we were looking at the religion as only a system of beliefs? For instance, does the sense of time of people who adhere to the religion’s calendar of remembrances differ from the sense of time of people who do not? And what specifically would we do to learn about religion, if we concentrate on people’s actions? In opening up such inquiries students will learn both about studying religions and about major facets of religious traditions. The course will require reading and successful completion of tests. Visits to off-campus sites and completion of reports on site visits will facilitate learning through encounter and participation. Students will also undertake a project using concepts from the course to imagine and interpret lived religion in behaviors or in aspects of the physical or social world. The religions, practices, and sites for study, observation, and interpretation—as well as the assignments—may vary each time the course is offered. This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement.",4,Unknown
Religious Studies,RLGS 2310 World Christianities  (4 Credits),"This class will be an exploration of the variety of Christian expressions that have developed around the globe. As Christianity has spread through conquest, missionary work, immigration, trade, and other means, new converts and their offspring have had to reconcile Christian doctrines, rituals, and ethics with the beliefs and practices of their own cultures. This has led to what some scholars have referred to variously as mixing, syncretism, hybridity, creolization, contextualization and/or enculturation. This class, while considering the value of these terms, will, however, take the following as it’s foundational perspective: from the early Christian community to contemporary denominational specificity, all forms of Christianity have emerged as a result of cultural contextualization.

Focusing on feature films and documentaries, it employs film to open up a broad spectrum of questions relating to personal piety, gender equity, generational conflicts, social class, governmental repression, and ritual practice.  Proceeding thematically along a broad historical frame, the course focuses on the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, presenting a balanced picture of life in Muslim-majority and Muslim-minority countries and highlighting the complex picture of Muslim life today.

Religious Studies,RLGS 2600 Religion and Popular Culture  (4 Credits),"Although religion and popular culture are often seen as separate conceptual spheres—the former dealing with the “sacred” and the latter with the “profane”—these two spheres are deeply intertwined and shape one another.

Sociology,SOCI 2722 Criminal Justice Reform in the U.S.  (4 Credits),"Events in 2020 have left many people wondering why our criminal justice system looks as it does today and asking what we can do to make it better. Despite the wave of political and cultural support for reform, little has changed. Why? The answers lie in the complicated historical processes that created the loose network of institutions that we refer to as ""the criminal justice system,"" and in the contemporary socioeconomic and political structures that sustain these institutions. To better understand the contemporary state of reform, we will study the forces that gave rise to them, including race's central role in the politics of criminal justice, and the complexities of American federalism. We will research contemporary reform efforts targeting policing, mass incarceration, prosecutorial discretion, and other issues. Prerequisite:SOCI 1810.",4,Unknown
Sociology,SOCI 2724 Law and Social Control  (4 Credits),"Why do people obey the law even when doing so is not to their benefit? How do legal systems mobilize the threat of punishment to compel obedience? How do legal issues and institutions reflect deeper forces rooted in social life? This course explores these questions and examines how socio-legal and sociology of punishment scholarship help explain contemporary and historical developments in law and social control. We emphasize law’s role in establishing and maintaining particular forms of social order, and explore how this becomes manifest in modern institutions, especially criminal justice systems. Prerequisite:SOCI 1810.",4,Unknown
Sociology,SOCI 2726 Hate Crimes and Hate Groups  (4 Credits),"This course will examine how hate crimes and hate groups in the United States have been studied by social scientists and how their findings can inform the public good. Over the quarter this course will explore how hate crimes are defined relative to other forms of bias and crime, how the criminal justice system addresses hate crime and bias, how social movement mobilization influences hate crime trends, and how hate groups influence bias and hate incidents in the United States. The course will begin by asking how we all view hate in the United States, Colorado, and Denver as lay people. Then we will explore the political determinants and forces as play in how hate crime laws came to fruition and their argued effects. Next we will explore trends and patterns in hate crime victimization and offending. Next we will explore research on hate group ideologies, formation, and relations to hate crime offending. Finally, we will conclude with broader look at how hate relates to long term trends in violence and the state and what seems to be the next best steps for addressing hate in the United States.

We will also consider the impact of contemporary technological developments on violence and social control. Prerequisite:SOCI 1810or permission of instructor.,4,Unknown
Sociology,SOCI 2737 The Sociology of Denial and Acknowledgment  (4 Credits),"Humans are adept at downplaying, excusing, and outright ignoring uncomfortable truths. In our everyday encounters, we overlook our stumbles, mistakes, and blemishes to avoid embarrassing each other. In this way, denial allows us to maintain smooth social interactions, even in the face of disturbances. At the same time, denial permits us to live with extreme forms of inequality, deep and abiding social problems, and violations of others’ rights. Many of us rationalize inaction in the face of others’ suffering or overlook the bad decisions – and crimes too – of our political allies. In this class, we will investigate denial and its functions. We will also examine the efforts people make to overcome collective denial through interventions, acknowledgment, and memorialization.

Prerequisite:SOCI 1810or permission of instructor.",4,Unknown
Sociology,SOCI 2751 Masculinities and Sexualities  (4 Credits),"This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to explore the intersections of masculinities and sexualities in our culture. Through scholarly works in the studies of media, gender, sexualities, sociology, anthropology, and history, we will examine personal narratives, art, film, media, and literature to uncover power and inequality as they are complicated by a hierarchy of multiple masculine and sexual identities. Beyond gender and sexuality, we will also consider the significance of race, class, and disabilities as they also impact the lived experiences of people who claim masculine and sexual identities. This course will employ a variety of methods for uncovering what it means to be masculine and a sexual person in our contemporary culture. Prerequisite:SOCI 1810.",4,Unknown
Sociology,SOCI 2752 Youth in Society  (4 Credits),"Although commonly understood to be a natural and universal phase in the life course, many scholars argue that “youth” is socially constructed. The goal of this course is to examine how young people in the United States are both “constructed” as a distinct social group by institutions such as media, schooling, criminal justice, and work, and how youth in turn construct their own social worlds and even spark social change. This is a hands-on exploratory course about youth cultures, youth issues, generational differences, and age as an axis of inequality. This means that in addition to reading about historic and contemporary youth, students will get a chance to explore a youth issue, controversy, or subculture in real time by reviewing relevant sociological research and collecting original data. Prerequisite:SOCI 1810.",4,Unknown
Sociology,SOCI 2753 Immigration and the Law  (4 Credits),"International migration to the US and the political and legal questions it raises are seemingly omnipresent and ever controversial. This class will seek to make sense of immigration law with a focus on the contemporary era. We will focus on the construction of illegality of immigrants, and the “criminalization” of immigration law. What explains such trends? How have they played out amongst the public and policymakers, in the courts, and in the federal bureaucracy? How have states and local governments acted? What are the consequences for immigrants, their families, and communities when some must live in states of uncertain legality? Finally, how do immigrants and their allies resist these broader trends? By examining causes and consequences of US immigration law in the contemporary era, students will be able to make sense of an ever-controversial topic. Prerequisite:SOCI 1810.",4,Unknown
Sociology,SOCI 2756 Environmental Justice  (4 Credits),"This course starts from the premise that all people have a right to live in a clean environment and access resources to sustain health and livelihood. We will examine issues at the intersection of environmental change and environmental justice (EJ). EJ issues revolve around the race-, class-, and equity-based implications of environmental problems. This course presents research on environmental quality and health, enforcement of regulations, access to resources, response to urban industrial problems, and the broader political economy of decision-making around environmental issues. The course will also explore and critically analyze the philosophies, frameworks, and strategies underlying environmental justice movements and struggles of African American, Latinx, Asian American, and Indigenous communities. We will ask and seek to answer questions such as: How and why are environmental problems experienced differently according to race, gender, and class? How do different communities experience and respond to environmental problems? Why does it matter that there is unequal exposure to environmental risks and benefits? What does the study of environmental risks tell us about racism, classism, and sexism in our nation and world today? What is environmental privilege and why does it matter? Prerequisite:SOCI 1810.",4,Unknown
Sociology,SOCI 2757 State Violence  (4 Credits),"This course applies a socio-legal approach to the study of state violence.

Sociology,SOCI 2758 Criminology from a Radical Perspective  (4 Credits),"In this course we will analyze several topics in criminology using a radical perspective. Radical criminology understands crime and criminal behavior from structural, anti-statist, and anti-capitalist perspectives. It asks questions like, “how does the distribution of political and economic power in capitalist society result in some harmful acts – typically those committed by the poor – being defined and treated as serious crime, while other equally harmful acts – typically those committed by people in positions of power – are often either not defined as criminal, or treated as minor technical offenses?” And, “how do “street crimes” result from the distortions of human lives that arise from oppressive and alienating experiences?” We will go over the development of radical criminological thought, criminology of resistance, Marxist methods, the role of state and law, radical perspectives on policing, courts, punishment, and corrections, as well as the future of the field. Prerequisite:SOCI 1810.",4,Unknown
Sociology,"SOCI 2759 Space, Crime and Criminal Justice  (4 Credits)","By reading socio-spatial theory, studying recent literature on crime, space, and place, and using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software, students will gain experience in making maps, obtaining data, uncovering spatial patterns to inform public policy, and conceptualizing space and place. Space and place are dynamic social forces. The spatial aspects of where we live and how we interact can influence the way we experience the social and physical world. Thus, it is important to consider how crime is distributed within and across neighborhoods, communities, cities, states, etc. as well as how the criminal justice system relates to space and place. Throughout the course we will utilize theory and research from critical criminology and critical human geography to better understand how space, place, and crime intersect with inequality. We will also use computer applications – QGIS and GeoDa – to uncover socio-spatial patterns of crime and criminal justice processes. The demand for individuals with basic skills in GIS and spatial analysis has grown throughout a variety of industries and fields. This course is designed to introduce GIS and spatial analysis while providing a basic understanding of spatial methods and help students realize the increased opportunities in the labor market or when applying to graduate school.

Sociology,"SOCI 2762 Work, Law and Inequality  (4 Credits)","Work is a central institution of modern societies. Much of our adult lives revolve around paid employment: finding it, keeping it, and deciding whether and when to change it up. Whether jobs are plentiful or scarce, highly paid or undervalued, safe or dangerous, are not just market questions, but legal and political ones. In this course, we will examine the relationship between work and the law in recent U.S. history, focusing on the transition from a legal regime that provided for well-paying and secure jobs to one in which precarity reigns, illegal conditions have become endemic in many industries, and a significant number of jobs in the so-called “platform” economy exist beyond the reach of workplace laws. Prerequisite:SOCI 1810.",4,Unknown
Sociology,SOCI 2765 The Female Offender  (4 Credits),"Female offenders are one of the fastest growing segments in both the juvenile and adult justice systems. This course introduces students to debates and issues surrounding girls, women, and crime; explores different theoretical perspectives of gender and crime; and examines the impact of gender on the construction and treatment of female offenders by the justice system. In addition, this course specifically looks at girls' and women's pathways to offending and incarcerations; understanding girls' violence in the inner city; exploring the reality of prison life for women, with a particular focus on the gender-sensitive programming for incarcerated mothers; and ending with an examination of how capital punishment has affected women offenders historically and contemporarily.

Spanish,SPAN 2802 Afro-Latinos in the US  (4 Credits),"Afro-Latin@s (Afro-Latinos and Afro-Latinas) is a group designation for a community that, until recently, had not tended to call itself, or to have been called, in that way. The group’s past, however, demonstrates a sense of tradition and shared social and cultural realities, and the term is increasingly being used in the twenty-first century. Particular to the USA context, as opposed to Latin American countries, is that here the Afro-Latin@ experience has to do with the cross-cultural relation between the Afro and the Latin@, which means most conspicuously the relation between Latin@s and African Americans. It is important, however, not to limit the concept to that connection and recognize the presence of a group that embodies both at once. This class explores the history of Afro-Latin@s in the USA, as well as examples of unique lived experiences of Afro-Latin@ individuals navigating their social identities as they intersect with other Blacks and Latin@s. The identity field linking Black Latin Americans and Latin@s across national and regional lines will remain within focus.

Spanish,SPAN 2803 Religion and Violence in Latin America  (4 Credits),"The Spanish and Portuguese imposed Catholicism in the Americas during the conquest and colonization, brutally repressing indigenous religious expression through persecution and forced conversions. While Catholic doctrine officially replaced the polytheism, animism and ancestor worship of indigenous religions, in actuality, the Colonial period saw great diversity in religious practice, as indigenous populations and African slaves developed systems of religious syncretism adapting the Catholic dogma to their beliefs and practices. However, although Latin America is currently home to more than 425 million Catholics –an estimated 40% of the Catholic population worldwide– and the Roman Catholic Church now has a Latin American pope for the first time in its history, the region is far from being religiously homogeneous. Since independence, immigration, politics, and economics have played an important role in effectively changing the religious demography of Latin America. This course will examine religion and violence in Latin America, from pre-Columbian times until 1983, focusing on the relationship between religion and political power. We will explore pre-Columbian religions; the role of religion in the conquest and colonization of the Americas; African religion and slave religious ritual; religious syncretism; religious art; immigration and religion; revolution and religion; and the political implications of Protestantism and Liberation Theology.

Spanish,SPAN 2805 The Sociopolitics of a Majority-Minority Language in the U.S.  (4 Credits),"This course is an introduction and critical exploration of the sociohistorical, sociopolitical and sociolinguistic implications of Spanish as a language of use in local communities across the United States. Because the primary focus of exploration, in this case, is the social and political issues related to Spanish in the U.S., we will focus on its use and representation, rather than on its linguistic representation. Similarly, we will conceive of language—any language—as social action, particularly the ways in which people use language to convey social and political meanings. To achieve such an undertaking, students will be exposed to an interdisciplinary, sociopolitical approach to a language spoken by more than 40 million people in the United States today (American Community Survey, 2020), exploring the complex historical context that makes Spanish the de facto second language spoken locally as well as nationally. Key to this analysis will be the introduction of social constructionism and other critical sociolinguistic notions that explain social categories such as race, language, gender and class as not fixed but rather, socially constructed. In all, this course will explore how Spanish, as a minority-majority language, presents fertile ground for recognizing the social and political implications of language use. Students will engage with the material through course lectures, active discussions, and analyses of real-life examples of Spanish use on the ground. This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement. No knowledge of Spanish is required or expected. This class will be conducted in English and will not count toward the minor in Spanish. A total of only 4 credits from any SPAN28XX course may count toward the major in Spanish.",4,Beginner
Spanish,SPAN 2806 Latin American Food Landscapes  (4 Credits),"This course focuses on the ways in which Latin American food landscapes —alimentary cultivation, production, purveyance, preparation, and consumption— reveal the complexities of various political, socioeconomic, ecological, and cultural contexts. Students will be challenged to consider the ways in which, throughout the Américas and since the pre-conquest era, diverse food landscapes have often provided marginalized individuals and communities with opportunities to creatively resist policies or prejudices aimed at erasing local food and agricultural practices and preferences.

Spanish,SPAN 2808 Inventing Latin America  (4 Credits),"In this course we will explore the Idea of Latin America in a broader context of social constructs and social formations using theoretical frameworks from History, Anthropology, Geography and Semiotics. Students in this course will learn and assimilate theoretical tools to identify what a social construct is, how it is built, used, and how it changes. Based on readings focused on specific examples in the history of the mass of land called first new world, first America, west indies and later, Latin America, we will analyze the ways in which temporal and spatial dimensions are enforced to build these and other concepts that are part of the global process of cultural negotiations. Modernity, traditional, underdeveloped, exotic, “western” or “not western” are part of the vocabulary that informs what has been called “politics of time and politics of space”. We will focus specially on the ways the binominal Latino/a and Latin America is used in the context of the multicultural idea of the USA, underlaying the difference in meaning when the term has been employed in the context of national discourses in Latin America. This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement. No knowledge of Spanish is required or expected.

You’ll explore how physical actor training strengthens and improves the ability to speak while ultimately allowing you to embody a character more successfully. Drawing from many areas of study in movement and voice, you will connect physical and vocal action through a series of exercises and explorations. Specifically, we’ll investigate 1) how to prepare your body for performance circumstances and to successfully support your vocal needs, and 2) how your body and voice can work symbiotically during performance to deliver a more powerful, precise, engaging performance. The course will begin with extensive physical and vocal actor training; then we’ll apply this training to specific theatrical texts; it will culminate in a collaborative performance that will provide opportunities for both individual and group performances. This work will strengthen stage presence and characterization and will heighten your emotional and physical power and commitment to each moment onstage.

Writing,WRIT 3600 Black Studies Capstone  (4 Credits),"This capstone course is designed for students completing the Minor in Black Studies at the University of Denver. The primary goal of this course is to create an original capstone project that demonstrates synthesis of their study in the field and deepens their skills in research. Black Studies minors should plan to enroll in BLST 3600 after completing all course work for the minor. As part of this capstone course, each student will complete a capstone project, of their own design, that explores some aspect of Black/African American life, history, culture, or experience. This course encourages creative capstone projects that allow students to present their work in a form other than the standard written thesis model.
This course will guide the capstone projects for students conducting intensive research on topics in Black Studies. Drawing from disciplinary and interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and concepts in the humanities and social sciences, capstone project topics will cover broadly defined themes in Black Studies such as the effects of Atlantic slavery on the United States, the Americas, Africa, and Europe; the Black freedom struggle in the United States; and women, gender, and sexuality in Black America. Through a collaborative learning process, students will define clear project objectives, refine their analytical skills, effectively engage major issues in their research materials, and make critical intellectual interventions. Students will be encouraged to critically explore topics from courses they have taken in Black Studies and related disciplines as topics for their capstone research projects.",4,Advanced
